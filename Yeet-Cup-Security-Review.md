# 3. About Yeet Cup

Yeet It is a fully on-chain game with no dominant game theoretic strategy to win. Players can make money in multiple ways.

The game is played by depositing `$BERA` into the pool, and the winner is rewarded the pool of assets once the finish condition is met. The game also has simple token economics attached to it where we will be giving out daily rewards in the form of `$YEET` tokens to players who deposit assets into the pool during that period. The rewards are distributed each epoch (24 hours) and are done so pro-rata to each player according to how much `$BERA` they deposited in the epoch that has just elapsed. Anyone can also stake their `$YEET` tokens to earn a share of the assets that are deposited into the pool by players.

The core premise of the game is:

1. Players yeet `$BERA` into a pool
2. The last player to make a yeet, wins `80%` of the whole pool

   - `20%` is split among 10 random players

3. You can yeet as much as you want as long as it is equal to or greater than `0.5%` of the current pool value (this ensures that the game eventually ends and that there is a winner)
4. You earn `$YEET` tokens by making yeets
5. `10%` of every yeet is taxed and is split among:

   - `7%` to `$YEET` stakers
   - `1%` to the `$BERA/$YEET` liquidity pool - to be placed strategically in the v3 pool
   - `2%` to BERA8 - retroactive ecosystem and public goods funding by The Honey Jar

# 4. Risk Classification

|        Severity        | Impact: High | Impact: Medium | Impact: Low |
| :--------------------: | :----------: | :------------: | :---------: |
|  **Likelihood: High**  |   Critical   |      High      |   Medium    |
| **Likelihood: Medium** |     High     |     Medium     |     Low     |
|  **Likelihood: Low**   |    Medium    |      Low       |     Low     |

## 4.1 Impact

- **High** - results in a significant risk for the protocolâ€™s overall well-being. Affects all or most users
- **Medium** - results in a non-critical risk for the protocol affects all or only a subset of users, but is still
  unacceptable
- **Low** - losses will be limited but bearable - and covers vectors similar to griefing attacks that can be easily repaired

## 4.2 Likelihood

- **High** - almost certain to happen and highly lucrative for execution by malicious actors
- **Medium** - still relatively likely, although only conditionally possible
- **Low** - requires a unique set of circumstances and poses non-lucrative cost-of-execution to rewards ratio for the actor

# 5. Security Review Summary

The security review lasted 1 week with a total of 200 hours dedicated to the audit by five researchers from the Shieldify team.

Overall, the code is well-written. The audit report contributed by identifying several Critical and High severity issues, concerning wrong calculations and loss of rewards, among other issues with lower severity.

The code lacks tests of any kind which hindered the auditing process to a certain extent. Nevertheless, the Yeet team's responsiveness and extensive feedback to all code and logic-related questions made up for this.

# [C-01] Direct Loss of Rewards on Re-Staking

## Severity

Critical Risk

## Description

The `reStake()` method of the `DiscreteStakingRewards` contract intends to add a user's (`msg.sender`) earned rewards to their staked balance instead of claiming those rewards. This is done by clearing the user's earned rewards and forwarding them to the contract's `stake()` method.  
However, the `stake()` method is called _externally_ and therefore the `msg.sender` will be the contract itself (`address(this)`) during the stake call.

Consequently, the user's earned rewards are re-staked on behalf of the contract instead of the user and are therefore lost. Furthermore, the re-staked rewards become stuck, since there is no way for the contract to redeem those "self-staked" amounts.

## Location of Affected Code

File: [src/Stake.sol#L163](https://github.com/0xKingKoala/contracts/blob/f43ad283290293e18e5d9ab0c9d56e29bffa3eb3/src/Stake.sol#L163)

```solidity
/// @notice The function used to re-stake the rewards without claiming them, bypassing the vesting period
/// @dev The rewards are staked again
function reStake() external {
    _updateRewards(msg.sender);
    uint reward = earned[msg.sender];
    require(reward > 0, "No rewards to claim");

    earned[msg.sender] = 0;
    this.stake(reward); // @audit msg.sender will be address(this) in stake call
}
```

## Recommendation

Directly increase the user's (`msg.sender`) staked balance:

```diff
function reStake() external {
    _updateRewards(msg.sender);
    uint reward = earned[msg.sender];
    require(reward > 0, "No rewards to claim");

    earned[msg.sender] = 0;

+   balanceOf[msg.sender] += reward;
+   totalSupply += reward;
-   this.stake(reward);
}
```

## Team Response

Fixed as suggested

# [C-02] User Claimable Reward Tokens Can Be Locked

## Severity

Critical Risk

## Description

In the `Reward.sol` file, the `currentEpoch` variable is defined as a `uint8`, which means it can only hold values from 0 to 255. Since each epoch lasts for a day, the maximum epoch possible is indeed 255. However, this setup could potentially lead to a Denial of Service (DoS) scenario for the entire protocol. This issue arises because when the epoch reaches 255, any attempt to increment it further, like during the `addYeetVolume()` function that calls `_endEpoch()` internally upon `yeeting`, will cause an overflow, resulting in a revert. Therefore, ending the 255th epoch is impossible.

The `getClaimableAmount()` function loops through each epoch. However, it is important to note that although the maximum value of `currentEpoch` is 255, no amounts can be claimed beyond that point because no new epochs can be finalized.

## Attack Scenario

To understand better the vulnerability let's look at the following example:

1. The `currentEpoch` is `255`.
2. Alice yeets and now participates in epoch `255` and `userYeetVolume[currentEpoch][user] += amount;` mapping will update Alice's data for the current epoch.
3. Once Epoch 255 concludes, the protocol attempts to increment the value, but hits a roadblockâ€”it's unable to proceed. Consequently, the protocol stalls, unable to advance to the next epochs.
4. Alice tries to claim her rewards for epoch `255` but the tx will return 0, because `epoch < currentEpoch` is going to be `false`.

```solidity
/// @notice Calculate the amount of tokens that a user can claim
/// @dev if no one yeets, the epoch will never end, and the user can never claim (should not really be a problem)
function getClaimableAmount(address user) public view returns (uint256) {
    uint256 totalClaimable = 0;

    // Fixed-point arithmetic for more precision
    uint256 scalingFactor = 1e18;

@>  for (uint256 epoch = lastClaimedForEpoch[user] + 1; epoch < currentEpoch; epoch++) {
        if (totalYeetVolume[epoch] == 0) continue; // Avoid division by zero

        uint256 userVolume = userYeetVolume[epoch][user];
        uint256 totalVolume = totalYeetVolume[epoch];

        uint256 userShare = (userVolume * scalingFactor) / totalVolume;

        uint256 maxClaimable = (epochRewards[epoch] / rewardsSettings.MAX_CAP_PER_WALLET_PER_EPOCH_FACTOR());
        uint256 claimable = (userShare * epochRewards[epoch]) / scalingFactor;

        if (claimable > maxClaimable) {
            claimable = maxClaimable;
        }

        totalClaimable += claimable;
    }

    return totalClaimable;
}
```

## Recommendation

There are two possible solutions which should be considered:

1. The first solution is quite straightforward, consider changing the current type of `uint8 public currentEpoch` to `uint256 public currentEpoch`, however, bear in mind the potential gas costs for future users. For instance, if the current epoch represents a significant timeframe, e.g. `10 years = 3650 epochs` or `20 years = 7300 epochs`, gas expenses for new users could become quite high. This occurs because initially, a new user's `lastClaimedForEpoch[user]` value would be 0, causing the for loop to iterate from 0 to the current epoch (e.g., 3650 or 7300), resulting in considerable gas consumption.

2. Another solution with a higher complexity would be refactoring the code logic so there is a single mapping `address => uint256` being updated when a user has accrued any rewards without recording the epoch in the mapping.

# [H-01] Re-staking Mechanism Can Lead to Contract Insolvency

## Severity

High Risk

## Description

In the `DiscreteStakingRewards` contract, the staking rewards are paid in `BERA` (native has a token on [Berachain](https://docs.berachain.com/learn) while the locked staking tokens are `YEET`.  
However, the current re-staking mechanism allows to increase the staked `YEET` with `BERA` instead of claiming it as a reward.

As a consequence of re-staking, the `totalSupply` of `YEET` tokens in the contract will be higher than the _actual supply_ which can potentially lead to insolvency of the contract in terms of `YEET` tokens.  
Furthermore, treating `BERA` equivalently to `YEET` on re-staking comes with an economic disbalance since their respective prices are likely not equal at all times.

## Location of Affected Code

File: [src/Stake.sol#L157](https://github.com/0xKingKoala/contracts/blob/f43ad283290293e18e5d9ab0c9d56e29bffa3eb3/src/Stake.sol#L157)

```solidity
/// @notice The function used to re-stake the rewards without claiming them, bypassing the vesting period
/// @dev The rewards are staked again
function reStake() external {
    _updateRewards(msg.sender);
    uint reward = earned[msg.sender];
    require(reward > 0, "No rewards to claim");

    earned[msg.sender] = 0;
    this.stake(reward);
}
```

## Recommendation

`YEET` tokens should be bought with the `BERA` rewards before re-staking to prevent misaccounting of `BERA` as `YEET` and resolve the economic disbalance.

## Team Response

Fixed by temporarily removing the re-staking functionality that will be re-designed

# [H-02] Yeet Functionality Flaw Upon Contract Deployment or Restart Due to Wrong Calculation

## Severity

High Risk

## Description

After deploying the Yeet contract or executing the `restart()` function, the `_potToWinner` value remains 0 until either the `receive()` or `fallback()` function is invoked. Meanwhile, the `yeet()` function is payable and aims to enforce a minimum amount of Yeet points to be passed, calculated through the `_minimumYeetPoint()` function. This calculation involves dividing the `totalPot` by `POT_DIVISION` and it will yield 0 due to the absence of funds in the pot.

Consequently, a user could successfully execute `yeet()` with 0 wei, bypassing the intended minimum Yeet point requirement.

Due to each game round's initial `minimumYeetPoint` of 0, an adversary can `yeet` an arbitrary amount of times with `0 <= msg.value < POT_DIVISION` and thereby gain an unfair advantage over other participants concerning the `Yeetback` winnings distribution. This is possible since the adversary will be added again to the `yeetsInRound` array of the `Yeetback` contract on each `yeet` and therefore increase their probability of being among the 10 winners during the final draw.

## Location of Affected Code

File: [src/Yeet.sol#L154](https://github.com/0xKingKoala/contracts/blob/f43ad283290293e18e5d9ab0c9d56e29bffa3eb3/src/Yeet.sol#L154)

```solidity
/// @notice yeet is the main function of the game, users yeet the native token in the pot
/// @notice The pot is divided into a winner pot and a yeetback pot
function yeet() external payable {
    uint timestamp = block.timestamp;
    require(timestamp < _endOfYeetTime, "Yeet: Yeet time has passed, game is over");

    uint256 minimumYeetPoint = _minimumYeetPoint(_potToWinner);
    require(msg.value >= minimumYeetPoint, "Yeet: Yeet not big enough");

    // code
}
```

## Recommendation

Consider re-designing the `_minimumYeetPoint()` function logic to handle the case when `totalPot` and still return a feasible minimum Yeet points amount, for example, require a minimum of `msg.value >= POT_DIVISION` on each `yeet` and therefore also resolve the integer division issue in `_minimumYeetPoint`.

# [M-01] Missing Vesting Period Verification in `unstake()` Method Puts Users at Risk

## Severity

Medium Risk

## Description

The `DiscreteStakingRewards` contract has a `rageQuit()` method which allows users to unstake before the vesting period has ended. Thereby, the user is at a (partial) loss which is intended and expected on a "rage quit".  
However, the `unstake()` method, which can be reasonably assumed to only allow unstaking once the vesting period has ended, is equivalent to the `rageQuit()` method and neglects to check the vesting period.

Consequently, users are at risk of having their stake (partially) burnt when calling `unstake()` which is not expected and therefore cannot be considered a careless user error.

```solidity
/// @notice The function used to unstake tokens
/// @param index The index of the vesting to unstake
function unstake(uint256 index) external {

# [M-02] Significantly Decreased Entropy in `draftWinners()` Method

## Severity

Medium Risk

## Description

In the `draftWinners` method of the `Yeet` contract, the initial entropy `randomNumber` is meant to be split 10 times into `smallNumbers` which are subsequently hashed to `randomData`. This `randomData` is meant to provide randomness for determining the winner in each iteration.  
However, it's currently unused and `randomNumber` is directly used without hashing.

Consequently, the entropy for drafting 10 winners is significantly reduced compared to the intended implementation. Currently, the only measure preventing all 10 winners from being the same is that the `randomNumber` is downshifted by 16 bits in each iteration, i.e. `randomNumber >>= 16`.

Use `randomNumber` instead of `randomData` in `Yeet`:

```diff
  // Seed a new random number with some entropy from the large random number

# [M-03] Dysfunctional Instantiation of the `Yeetback.sol` Contract

## Severity

Medium Risk

## Description

The `Yeetback` contract is expected to be constructed with an `entropy` contract, which implements the [IEntropy](https://github.com/pyth-network/pyth-crosschain/blob/main/target_chains/ethereum/entropy_sdk/solidity/IEntropy.sol) interface, and an `entropyProvider` contract as follows:

```solidity
constructor(
    address _entropy,
    address _entropyProvider
) Ownable(msg.sender) {
    entropy = IEntropy(_entropy);
    entropyProvider = _entropyProvider;
}
```

However, the `Yeet` contract itself (`address(this)`) is provided on construction which does not implement any of the `IEntropy` methods required by the `Yeetback` contract, nor does it serve with any `entropyProvider` functionality.

As a consequence, core methods, i.e. `restart`, `addYeetback` & `getEntropyFee`, of the `Yeet` and `Yeetback` contracts will always fail to work as expected.

# [M-04] Incomplete Validation

## Severity

Medium Risk

## Description

In the `NFTVesting.sol` contract the following validation checks are missing:

- In `constructor()` if `_startTime` is set in the past the `getTimePassed()` function will revert on every call and there `claim()` will be unusable. The same applies for `_vestingPeriod` and `_tokenAmount` to be greater than 0.
- In `claim()` function check whether the vesting period has started and whether the vesting period has ended. A zero-value check for `claimable` should be applied as well.

In the `Stake.sol` contract the following validation checks are missing:

- `stake()` and `startUnstake()` functions are missing zero-value checks.

In the `OnlyYeetContract.sol` contract the following validation checks are missing:

- `setYeetContract()` function missing zero address check for `_yeetContract` parameter.

In the `Reward.sol` contract the following validation checks are missing:

- `addYeetVolume()` function missing zero address check for `user` parameter.
- In the `addYeetVolume()` function there is a `require` statement which must not allow zero amount to be sent for the tx but the comparison allows zero value to pass.

In the `Yeet.sol` contract the following validation checks are missing:

- `constructor()` missing zero address check for `_publicGoodsAddress`, `_lpStakingAddress` and `_teamAddress`.
- `restart()` function missing empty bytes check for `userRandomNumber` parameter.
- `setPublicGoodsAddress()`, `setLpStakingAddress()`, `setTreasuryRevenueAddress()`, `setYeetardsNFTsAddress()` functions are missing zero address checks.

In the `Yeetback.sol` contract the following validation checks are missing:

- `constructor()` missing zero address check for `_entropy` and `_entropyProvider` parameters.
- `addYeetsInRound()` function missing zero-value check for `round` and zero address check for `user` parameters.
- `addYeetback()` function missing empty bytes check for `userRandomNumber` and zero-value checks for `round` and `amount` parameters.
- `claim()` function zero-value check for the `round` parameter.

# [L-01] The `latestHistoryArr` Storage Array Is Ever Growing

## Severity

Low Risk

## Description

The `latestHistoryArr` storage array is intended to only record the last `LATEST_HISTORY_LENGTH` yeets, see code below:

```solidity
if (latestHistoryArr.length >= LATEST_HISTORY_LENGTH) {
    delete latestHistoryArr[0];
}

latestHistoryArr.push(History(
    msg.sender,
    timestamp,
    _potToWinner - valueToPot,
    _potToWinner,
    _yeetTimeInSeconds,
    _minimumYeetPoint(_potToWinner),
    _nrOfYeets,
    roundNumber
));
```

However, the `latestHistoryArr` array is ever-growing since the `delete latestHistoryArr[0]` statement only clears the storage slot at array index 0, but does not reduce the array's length.  
Therefore, the `latestHistoryArr` array effectively contains the whole history except for the very first entry.

    if (latestHistoryArr.length >= LATEST_HISTORY_LENGTH) {
        delete latestHistoryArr[0];
    }

    // code
}
```

## Recommendation

For the purpose of keeping the last `LATEST_HISTORY_LENGTH` entries, it is recommended to implement a ring buffer mechanism, which is especially favourable since it avoids unnecessary storage/gas overhead because the relocation of other array elements is not needed.

# [L-02] `call()` Should Be Used Instead of `transfer()` on an `address payable`

## Severity

Low Risk

## Description

The `transfer()` and `send()` functions forward a fixed amount of 2300 gas. Historically, it has often been recommended to use these functions for value transfers to guard against reentrancy attacks. However, the gas cost of EVM instructions may change significantly during hard forks which may break already deployed contract systems that make fixed assumptions about gas costs. For example. EIP 1884 broke several existing smart contracts due to a cost increase in the SLOAD instruction.

## Scenario

Additionally, the use of the deprecated `transfer()` function for an address will inevitably make the transaction fail when:

- The claimer smart contract does not implement a payable function.
- The claimer smart contract does implement a payable fallback which uses more than 2300 gas units.
- The claimer smart contract implements a payable fallback function that needs less than 2300 gas units but is called through a proxy, raising the call's gas usage above 2300.
- Additionally, using more than 2300 gas might be mandatory for some multisig wallets.

## Recommendation

Use `call()` instead of `transfer()`, but be sure to respect the CEI pattern and/or add re-entrance guards, as several hacks already happened in the past due to this recommendation not being fully understood.

# [L-05] Wrong Event Value Causes Confusion

## Severity

Low Risk

## Description

The `Reward._endEpoch()` function is meant to end an epoch if the current `block.timestamp` is greater than `epochEnd`, set the starting of a new epoch and calculate the rewards. The problem occurs when the `EpochEnded` event is emitted.

In this context, it's vital for the event to emit both the epoch that just concluded and its corresponding timestamp. However, a challenge arises because the epoch parameter passed to the event undergoes incrementation just before emission. Consequently, the event emits the upcoming epoch rather than the one that has ended, potentially causing confusion for users and contracts relying on this information.

## Description

In the `draftWinners()` method, 10 winners are drafted in a loop based on `randomData` which is the `keccak256` hash of `smallNumbers`.
Each iteration's `smallNumbers` are derived from the base entropy given by `randomNumber` and could potentially be the same in multiple iterations leading to drafting the same winner multiple times.

## Location of Affected Code

```solidity
bytes32 randomData = keccak256(abi.encodePacked(smallNumbers));

## Recommendation

In order to increase the pseudo-randomness based on the entropy given by `randomNumber`, it is recommended to hash further data like the loop counter `i` and the `block.timestamp`.

```diff

# [R-01] Miscellaneous Remarks

- The codebase in scope does not fund the `Reward` contract with YEET tokens. Make sure the `Reward` contract is appropriately funded during operation to avoid insolvency.
- Set the `yeetardsNFTsAddress` in the constructor of the Yeet contract, similar to other addresses which are required for operation. Otherwise, the `yeet()` method will fail when used after deployment without `yeetardsNFTsAddress` being set.
- Adding a start delay on each new round. Currently, a user could call `restart()` and `yeet()` within the same transaction which is an unfair advantage over other participants, since the first one to `yeet()` is added to the `Yeetback` draw for the lowest price.

# [I-02] Unnecessary Imports and Variables

## Description

- There is no point in importing `Ownable` in contracts that inherit from other contracts that already have imported it.
- Consider removing the testing import - `import "forge-std/console.sol";` from `Yeet`, `Stake` and `Reward` contracts.
- The `isInitialized` variable in `YeetToken` is defined and never used, consider removing it.
- Unnecessary balance sufficiency check in `claim()` in Reward.sol.
- In `Yeet.sol:L322`, cache the global constant `LATEST_HISTORY_LENGTH` instead of shadowing it with a local magic number.
- The `tokenContract` (YEET token) is not used at all within the `Yeet` contract. Reconsider any intended interaction.

# [I-03] Inconsistency with the Licenses

## Description

`NFTVesting`, `Stake`, `RewardSettings` and `YeetGameSettings` are missing SPDX License Identifier, the other contracts except for `YeetToken` are `UNLICENSED`.

SPDX License Identifiers are crucial because they provide clear and standardized information about the licensing terms under which a software or contract is distributed. This information helps users and developers understand their rights and obligations when using or modifying the code. Additionally, SPDX License Identifiers facilitate compliance with open-source licensing requirements, promote legal clarity, and encourage collaboration within the software development community.

## Recommendation

Consider selecting an appropriate license for your contracts and consistently applying it across all contracts to ensure legal clarity and foster a collaborative development environment.

# [I-04] Some Event Parameters Are Not `indexed`

## Description

Some event parameters are not `indexed`. While this does not pose any threat to the code, it makes it cumbersome for the off-chain scripts to efficiently filter them. Making the event parameters `indexed` will improve the off-chain servicesâ€™ ability to search and filter them.

# [I-05] Ownership Role Transfer Function Implement `Single-Step Role` Transfer

## Description

The current ownership transfer process for all the contracts inheriting from `Ownable` involves the current owner calling the `transferOwnership()` function. If the nominated EOA account is not a valid account, it is entirely possible that the owner may accidentally transfer ownership to an uncontrolled account, losing access to all functions with the `onlyOwner` modifier.

File: src/RewardSettings.sol

File: src/Yeetback.sol

File: src/YeetGameSettings.sol

File: src/YeetToken.sol

## Recommendation

It is recommended to implement a two-step process where the owner nominates an account and the nominated account needs to call an `acceptOwnership()` function for the transfer of the ownership to fully succeed. This ensures the nominated EOA account is a valid and active account. This can be easily achieved by using OpenZeppelinâ€™s `Ownable2Step` contract instead of `Ownable`.

## Recommendation

Ensure that each state-altering method emits a suitable event to adhere to established best practices.

# [G-01] `getWinners()` Method Missing Pagination

Add pagination to the `getWinners()` method of the `Yeet` contract to avoid perpetually growing gas costs of this call.

# [G-02] Cache array length outside of a loop

If not cached, the solidity compiler will always read the length of the array during each iteration. That is, if it is a storage array, this is an extra sload operation (100 additional extra gas for each iteration except for the first) and if it is a memory array, this is an extra mload operation (3 additional gas for each iteration except for the first).

# [G-04] Using `private` rather than `public` for constants, saves gas

If needed, the values can be read from the verified contract source code, or if there are multiple values there can be a single getter function that [returns a tuple](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-08-frax/blob/90f55a9ce4e25bceed3a74290b854341d8de6afa/src/contracts/FraxlendPair.sol#L156-L178) of the values of all currently-public constants. Saves **3406-3606 gas** in deployment gas due to the compiler not having to create non-payable getter functions for deployment calldata, not having to store the bytes of the value outside of where it's used, and not adding another entry to the method ID table

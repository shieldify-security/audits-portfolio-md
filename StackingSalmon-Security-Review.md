# 4. Risk Classification

|        Severity        | Impact: High | Impact: Medium | Impact: Low |
| :--------------------: | :----------: | :------------: | :---------: |
|  **Likelihood: High**  |   Critical   |      High      |   Medium    |
| **Likelihood: Medium** |     High     |     Medium     |     Low     |
|  **Likelihood: Low**   |    Medium    |      Low       |     Low     |

## 4.1 Impact

- **High** - results in a significant risk for the protocolâ€™s overall well-being. Affects all or most users
- **Medium** - results in a non-critical risk for the protocol affects all or only a subset of users, but is still
  unacceptable
- **Low** - losses will be limited but bearable - and covers vectors similar to griefing attacks that can be easily repaired

## 4.2 Likelihood

- **High** - almost certain to happen and highly lucrative for execution by malicious actors
- **Medium** - still relatively likely, although only conditionally possible
- **Low** - requires a unique set of circumstances and poses non-lucrative cost-of-execution to rewards ratio for the actor

# 5. Security Review Summary

The security review was conducted over the span of 25 days by the Shieldify team. The code is written professionally, and all best practices are considered. However, the security review uncovered several High- and Medium-severity issues, including incorrect chain setting assumptions, miscalculated fees, multiple front-running and DoS risks, unfair liquidations, and a few others, along with 10 Low-severity findings.

# 7. Findings

# [H-01] Incorrect Assumptions About Chain Native Token Will Heavily Skew Protocol Pricing Mechanism

## Severity

High Risk

## Description

In various parts of the contract, the native token is meant to be used. Contracts have payable receive functions, etc. The ante constant is set to an amount that otherwise would be reasonable, were the contracts to be deployed on a chain with an expensive native token like ETH. But the contracts are to be deployed on Berachain. Its native token is BERA, which at the time of writing, costs about $6,29 per ether. Compared to ETH which costs $2371 per ether, there is a very large price discrepancy which skews protocol pricing mechanisms, disincentivizes warnings, and liquidations, encourages bad debt, etc.

The default ante is 0.01 ether, which, based on our above pricing assumptions, is about $0,06 or 6 cents. Our max ante therefore will be about $3,14.

## Location of Affected Code

File: [src/libraries/constants/Constants.sol](https://github.com/cryptovash/sammin-core/blob/c49807ae2965cf6d121a10507a43de1d64ba1e70/core/src/libraries/constants/Constants.sol)

```solidity
/// @dev The default amount of Ether required to take on debt in a `Borrower`. The `Factory` can override this value
/// on a per-market basis. Incentivizes calls to `Borrower.warn`.
uint208 constant DEFAULT_ANTE = 0.01 ether; //@audit Bera is much cheaper than eth
```

```solidity
/// @dev The maximum amount of Ether that `Borrower`s can be required to post before taking on debt
uint216 constant CONSTRAINT_ANTE_MAX = 0.5 ether;
```

## Impact

The main impact here revolves around protocol pricing. Since the ante determines the minimum amount required to take on debt, having it as low as $0.06 strongly incentivizes borrowing, which can quickly lead to significant bad debt. Even if governance adjusts the ante upwards, `governMarketConfig()` enforces a cap (`CONSTRAINT_ANTE_MAX`) of just $3â€”still relatively low.

On top of that, the warning mechanism isn't compelling enough; with a minimum payout of either ante/4 or the contract balance, warners wonâ€™t be properly incentivized. As a result, liquidations wonâ€™t happen as frequently as needed, since warnings must occur before liquidation can take place.

## Recommendation

Create a governance function that can be used to update the ante and max ante values. This is a better option than hardcoding new ante values as token prices can change significantly over time.

## Team Response

Fixed.

# [H-02] The `feeProtocol` Calculation in the `VolatilityOracle::_getPoolMetadata()` Is Flawed

## Severity

High Risk

## Description

The `feeProtocol` calculation in the `VolatilityOracle::_getPoolMetadata()` is erroneous:

```solidity
unchecked {
  if (feeProtocol % 16 != 0) metadata.gamma0 -= uint24(fee / (feeProtocol % 16));
  if (feeProtocol >> 4 != 0) metadata.gamma1 -= uint24(fee / (feeProtocol >> 4));
}
```

The `feeProtocol` is given in `uint32` and the first 16 bits are for `token1` and the lower 16 bits are for `token0`.

But the above calculation uses only 8 bits for the `protocolFee` calculation, similar to UniswapV,3 but that is wrong with regard to Kodiak.

Furthermore, the `KodiakV3Factory` contract is deployed at `0xD84CBf0B02636E7f53dB9E5e45A616E05d710990` in Berachain.

In the constructor, the `defaultFeeProtocol` is given as

```solidity
defaultFeeProtocol = 229379500; //35%, 35%
```

Hence, this is equal to 3500, 3500 after converting to hexadecimal and then again to decimal for two tokens (token1 and token0).

Hence the `feeProtocol` is given in `basis points` and not as a `denominator` as with `UniswapV3 Pools`.

## Location of Affected Code

File: [src/VolatilityOracle.sol](https://github.com/cryptovash/sammin-core/blob/c49807ae2965cf6d121a10507a43de1d64ba1e70/core/src/VolatilityOracle.sol)

```solidity
unchecked {
    if (feeProtocol % 16 != 0) metadata.gamma0 -= uint24(fee / (feeProtocol % 16));
    if (feeProtocol >> 4 != 0) metadata.gamma1 -= uint24(fee / (feeProtocol >> 4));
}
```

## Impact

This will lead to wrong protocol fee calculation during the new market creation and these erroneous values will result in providing wrong Implied Volatility values in the `VolatilityOracle`. This will result in erroneous price values being given as output of the `Borrower::getPrices()` function. Hence the critical function execution in the `Borrower` contract, which uses the `getPrices()` such as the `modify()`, `liquidate()`, `warn()` and `clear()`, will be broken.

## Recommendation

Hence it is recommended to change the `feeProtocol` calculation logic in the `VolatilityOracle::_getPoolMetadata()` to use the entire `uint32` value. And consider the decoded fee value as a basis point and not as the denominator of the total fee.

## Team Response

Fixed.

# [M-01] Front-Running Vulnerability in `enrollCourier()` Function

## Severity

Medium Risk

## Description

The `enrollCourier()` function allows users to enroll in a referral program by associating their address with a unique `courierId` and a `cut` value, which represents the portion of the interest they will receive, from the interest earned by the referrer. The function includes a requirement that the `cut` for a given `courierId` must be zero before enrollment as shown below:

```solidity
require(couriers[id].cut == 0);
```

The above check is in place to ensure that once a particular `id` has been enrolled its information can not be changed.
This requirement further ensures that each `courierId` can only be used once. However, it also opens up the possibility for an attacker to front-run a `enrollCourier()` transaction. By monitoring the network for transactions attempting to enroll a specific `courierId`, an attacker can quickly submit their own transaction with the same id and a `cut > 0` value, causing the original transaction to revert since the `courierId` is already taken.

Since the protocol is implemented in the `Berachain` this vulnerability is easy to exploit due to low gas fees.

## Location of Affected Code

File: [Factory.sol]()

```solidity
function enrollCourier(uint32 id, uint16 cut) external {
    // Requirements:
    // - `id != 0` because 0 is reserved as the no-courier case
    // - `cut != 0 && cut < 10_000` just means between 0 and 100%
    require(id != 0 && cut != 0 && cut < 10_000);
    // Once an `id` has been enrolled, its info can't be changed
    require(couriers[id].cut == 0);

    couriers[id] = Courier(msg.sender, cut);
    emit EnrollCourier(id, msg.sender, cut);
}
```

## Impact

Denial of Service: Genuine users can be prevented from enrolling with their desired `courierId`, as the attacker can claim the id first.
Loss of Incentives: Users may lose the opportunity to earn incentives through the referral program if they cannot register.

## Recommendation

Hence it is recommended to maintain the `courierId` in the state of the `Factory` contract and increment it for each new `enrollCourier()` request. If the `courierId` needs to be provided by the `msg.sender` himself, then it is recommended to limit the number of `enrollCourier` requests a particular address can make by either imposing a limit per user or else by charging a small fee.

## Team Response

Fixed.

# [M-02] Front-Running Vulnerability in `Lender::redeem()` Function Leading to Denial of Redemption

## Severity

Medium Risk

## Description

The `Lender::redeem()` function is used to burn `shares` from the `owner` and send the `amount` of underlying tokens to the `receiver`. In the `redeem` function, after the respective `shares` are burnt, the following check is performed on the `cache.totalSupply` value.

```solidity
cache.totalSupply = _burn(owner, shares, inventory, cache.totalSupply);
require(cache.totalSupply == 0 || cache.totalSupply > 1e5);
```

The transaction will only proceed if the `cache.totalSupply` is either `0` or `>1e5`. Now let's consider the following scenario:

1. User A has `amount1` shares and the `totalSupply is also equal to amount1`.
2. User A decides to `redeem` his `amount1` shares and calls the `Lender::redeem()` function.
3. The transaction should proceed since now the `cache.totalSupply == 0`.
4. But an attacker `front-runs` the `redeem Tx` and deposits an amount equaling `1 wei` of shares into the `Lender` contract.
5. Now `User A` Tx executes and after the `_burn` execution the `cache.totalSupply == 1` and it is `!= 0 and < 1e5`. Hence the `UserA` redeems Tx reverts.

## Location of Affected Code

```solidity
cache.totalSupply = _burn(owner, shares, inventory, cache.totalSupply);
require(cache.totalSupply == 0 || cache.totalSupply > 1e5);
```

## Impact

A genuine user is unable to redeem his total amount of shares when he is the final `redeemer` of the `Lender` contract, even though the protocol logically allows the redemption.
This will degrade the user experience and will waste gas due to revert if the user calls the `redeem` multiple times.
The user will either have to redeem fewer shares than his total eligible share amount or wait for subsequent deposits to increase the `totalSupply > 1e5` (after the user redemption is accounted for). This is a loss of opportunity for the user.

## Recommendation

The following recommendations can be given to resolve this issue:

Implement a Minimum Share Requirement: Instead of checking the total supply, enforce a minimum share requirement for deposits. This would prevent dust amounts from being deposited in the first place, thus mitigating the issue without affecting redemptions.

## Team Response

Fixed.

# [M-03] Swap Callback Rejects Current Time as `deadline`

## Severity

Medium Risk

## Description

In `FrontendManager.sol`'s `callback()` function, if the action is 6, a swap action is supposed to take place. The function, however, rejects the `deadline` check if the current block time is less than the `deadline`.

## Location of Affected Code

File: [FrontendManager.sol]()

```solidity
if (action == 6) {
    (int256 amount0, int256 amount1, uint32 deadline) = abi.decode(args[i], (int256, int256, uint32));
    require(block.timestamp < deadline, "deadline");
    // code
}
```

## Impact

This violates the common DeFi practice of including the current time with the `deadline`. Also, since the function is used in `Borrower.sol`'s `liquidate` function, the caller may be a bot, keeper or a contract programmed to scan for borrowers to liquidate. Many of these external contracts are designed to use the current `block.timestamp` as `deadline`, therefore, this check will break integration.

## Recommendation

Consider using the `<=` operator instead.

## Team Response

Fixed.

# [M-04] Uniswap Position Fees Are Not Included in Asset Calculation For Warnings and Liquidation

## Severity

Medium Risk

## Description

Uniswap LPs earn fees for providing liquidity to Uniswap pools. These fees are, however, not taken as a part of the position's assets when the assets are being tallied for warning via the `_getAssets()` function. The function only returns the borrower's balance and pool liquidity at price points a and b as seen in the `Assets` struct.

## Location of Affected Code

File: [Borrower.sol]()

```solidity
function warn(uint40 oracleSeed) external {
    uint256 slot0_ = slot0;
    // Essentially `slot0.state == State.Ready && slot0.warnTime == 0`
    require(slot0_ & (SLOT0_MASK_STATE | SLOT0_MASK_AUCTION) == 0);

    // Fetch prices from oracle
    (Prices memory prices, , , uint208 ante) = getPrices(oracleSeed);
    // Tally assets
@>    Assets memory assets = _getAssets(slot0_, prices);
    // Fetch liabilities from lenders
    (uint256 liabilities0, uint256 liabilities1) = getLiabilities();
    // Ensure only unhealthy accounts get warned and liquidated
    require(!BalanceSheet.isHealthy(prices, assets, liabilities0, liabilities1), "Stacking Salmon: healthy");

    // Start auction

## Impact

Since the user's fees are not considered, a borrower could technically have enough assets, both in liquidity and fees, but will still be deemed unhealthy and prime for liquidation.

Worse, when a user is liquidated, their Uniswap positions are burned, and their fees are collected to Borrower.sol where it is eventually considered as part of the assets to put up for auction, in a way, sending the fees to the liquidators instead.

## Recommendation

It is recommended that users claim and account for their fees before evaluating their liquidation eligibility.

# [M-05] Incorrectly Hardcoded `_INIT_CODE_HASH` Parameter Will Lead to Wrong/Inability to Perform Appraisals

## Severity

Medium Risk

## Description

The `Uniswap.sol` incorrectly stores the `_INIT_CODE_HASH` as `0xe34f199b19b2b4f47f68442619d555527d244f78a3297ea89325f843f87b8b54`. This is incorrect as the protocol integrates with KodiakV3 which has a different init code hash.

From the [docs](https://documentation.kodiak.finance/overview/kodiak-contracts), the init code hash for v3 is `0xd8e2091bc519b509176fc39aeb148cc8444418d3ce260820edc44e806c2c2339`.

```

## Impact

Pool address computation will always be incorrect - see the `computePoolAddress()` function in `Uniswap.sol`. As a result, `getAppraisal()` will either return appraisal for an incorrect pool address or revert if the returned address doesn't correspond to a pool. This will also do the `getFormattedAppraisal()` function which depends on the `getAppraisal()` function.

## Recommendation

Update the `_INIT_CODE_HASH` parameter in `Uniswap.sol` to `0xd8e2091bc519b509176fc39aeb148cc8444418d3ce260820edc44e806c2c2339`.

# [M-06] Denial of Service Attacks on Router Permit Functions

## Severity

Medium Risk

## Description

The functions in `Router.sol` are the two `depositWithPermit2()` functions and the `repayWithPermit2()` function. These functions with the exception of one `depositWithPermit2()` proceeds in 2 steps:

1. Transferring the user-specified amount to Lender.sol via the `permitTransferFrom()` method.
2. Depositing/repaying the amount for the user.

The first `depositWithPermit2()` function adds an extra step which is:

1. Granting max approval to `Router.sol` using `permit` in `Lender.sol`.

Since the `permit()` function in `Lender.sol` and `permitTransferFrom` in Permit2.sol are both external,

An attacker can effectively halt these functions by monitoring the calls to obtain the various owner, spender, value, deadline, signature parameters and front-run the call, directly calling the `permit()`/`permitTransferFrom` functions in their respective contracts.

The same can be observed in the `processWithPermit()` function too, which calls `permit` in Lender.sol before calling `process`

## Location of Affected Code

    SignatureTransferDetails calldata transferDetails,
    address owner,
    bytes calldata signature
) external {
    _permitTransferFrom(permit, transferDetails, owner, permit.hash(), signature);
}
```

## Impact

An attacker running `permit()` with the same parameters as a legitimate call will cause approval to be given to `Router.sol`/`BadDebtProcessor.sol` while advancing the nonce.

By the time the user's legitimate call is processed, the nonce will be different and as such the calls will fail. Therefore, the function will fail and other steps of the function will be non-executable effectively dossing the process.

This can be arguably more impactful in `repayWithPermit2` because Lender.sol::repay can be time sensitive in case a user has been warned and it requires that tokens be transferred to the contract before repayment execution.

```solidity
  _save(cache, /* didChangeBorrowBase: */ true);

  // Ensure tokens are transferred
>>  require(cache.lastBalance <= asset().balanceOf(address(this)), "Stacking Salmon: insufficient pre-pay");

  emit Repay(msg.sender, beneficiary, amount, units);
}
```

## Proof of Concept

See [here](https://www.trust-security.xyz/post/permission-denied) for a deeper dive.

## Recommendation

Wrap the `permit()` function in a try-catch clause. Continue transaction if `permit()` succeeds. If `permit()` fails, check that the allowance is sufficient and continue anyway. Another potential fix is to introduce the same `didPrepay` bool into `repay` as was done in `deposit`. If not prepaid, use direct `safeTransferFrom` method instead.

# [M-07] Lack of `deadline` Check in the `BadDebtProcessor::uniswapV3FlashCallback()` Could Lead To Loss of Funds to the User

## Severity

Medium Risk

## Description

The `UNISWAP_POOL().swap()` is performed in the `FrontendManager::callback()` when the `action == 6` and in the `BoostManager::_action2Burn()` functions. In both those occasions, the `deadline` check is performed in addition to the slippage checks. This is to ensure that the transaction is not executed after a delay at an unfavourable price point to the user. The `slippage` check alone can not mitigate this issue since slippage applies to the derived swap value at the time of the transaction execution.

But the `UNISWAP_POOL().swap()` performed in the `BadDebtProcessor::uniswapV3FlashCallback()` only performs the slippage check but does not perform a deadline check.

## Location of Affected Code

File: [src/BadDebtProcessor.sol](https://github.com/cryptovash/sammin-core/blob/c49807ae2965cf6d121a10507a43de1d64ba1e70/helpers/src/BadDebtProcessor.sol)

```solidity
if (exactAmountOut < 0) {
      // Need to swap `token1` (the one we received during liquidation) for `token0` (which is `flashToken`)
    (, swapped) = borrower.UNISWAP_POOL().swap(
        address(this), false, exactAmountOut, TickMath.MAX_SQRT_RATIO - 1, bytes("")
    );
    require(uint256(swapped) < recovered * slippage / 10_000, "slippage");
}
```

## Impact

The `BadDebtProcessor::process()` transaction can be executed after a significant delay, which could prompt the asset ratios in the UniswapV3Pool to have changed considerably.

Hence the swapped and recovered asset amounts are calculated based on the highly altered price points. As a result, the provided slippage is stale and will not provide the required protection to the user, thus incurring loss to the user.

## Recommendation

Hence it is recommended to implement the deadline check in the `BadDebtProcessor::uniswapV3FlashCallback()` function to ensure execution of `BadDebtProcessor::process()` is not allowed after the given deadline.

The `deadline` should be passed as a user input to the `BadDebtProcessor::process()` function. This will ensure users will not lose funds due to delayed execution with stale slippage checks.

# [M-08] Unfair Liquidation of Healthy Accounts

## Severity

Medium Risk

## Description

A borrower can be unfairly liquidated even after becoming healthy if borrowing is paused and modification is restricted, and a liquidator front-runs the borrower's `Borrower::clear()` transaction. The `Borrower.liquidate()` function does not check if the borrower is currently healthy (`BalanceSheet.isHealthy()`), relying solely on the `warnTime` being greater than zero.

Furthermore, the `Borrower::clear()` can be called after the `LIQUIDATION_GRACE_PERIOD` to make an account healthy again. This allows a depositor to make their account healthy again by depositing directly to the lender and replenishing their ante even after the `LIQUIDATION_GRACE_PERIOD` has passed.

But the issue here is that a liquidator who doesn't immediately liquidate an unhealthy account (until 7 minutes have passed) since there is no incentive could observe this `Borrower::clear()` transaction and decide to front-run it with `liquidate()` transaction setting the `CloseFactor == 10000`. This will enable the liquidator to liquidate a healthy position maliciously and gain the ante as an incentive.

The vulnerability occurs in the following scenario:

1. A borrower's account becomes unhealthy and is warned via `Borrower.warn()`.
2. Borrowing is `paused` via `Factory.pause()`. This prevents the borrower from using `Borrower.modify()`.
3. The `LIQUIDATION_GRACE_PERIOD` expires.
4. The borrower decides to make his account healthy by directly depositing to the `Lender` contract and replenishing the ante in the `Borrower` contract. This would make the `BalanceSheet.isHealthy()` true again.
5. The borrower attempts to call `Borrower.clear()` to remove the warning status.
6. A liquidator observes the pending clear transaction and `front-runs` it with a `Borrower.liquidate()` transaction with `CloseFactor == 10000`.
7. Because `Borrower.liquidate()` only checks `warnTime > 0` and not `BalanceSheet.isHealthy()`, the liquidation proceeds.
8. The liquidator receives the borrower's full ante amount as a liquidation incentive, even though the borrower's account was healthy at the time of liquidation.

## Impact

- **Unfair Liquidation**: Borrowers who have taken steps to become healthy can be liquidated, losing their ante.

- **Liquidators making unfair profit**: Liquidators can profit by liquidating healthy accounts, exploiting a race condition.

- **Loss of Funds**: The borrower loses funds (up to the full ante value) unfairly.

## Recommendation

Implement an `isHealthy()` check at the beginning of the `Borrower.liquidate()` function, before setting the Borrower's state to `Locked`. This will prevent the liquidation of accounts that are currently healthy.

# [L-01] Signatures Have No Deadline and Cannot Be Cancelled

## Severity

Low Risk

## Description

The lack of a deadline or inability to be cancelled exists in the following contracts:

- `UniswapNFTManager.sol`'s `callback()` allows using signature permit withdrawal from the NFT. The permit is, however, flawed in that it has no deadline, and cannot be cancelled.
- `Lender.sol`'s `permit` signature cannot be cancelled too but has a deadline
  The signatures cannot be cancelled because the owner's `nonce` is increased in code, it cannot be directly increased by the owner if he wishes to, therefore cannot be manually invalidated.
- `BoostManager::_action0Mint()` function due to lack of a deadline check on the signature

## Impact

The lack of a way to increase nonce puts owners at risk if permission is granted to the wrong address, as such signatures cannot be cancelled. The lack of a deadline means the signature never expires and can be used long after it has been granted.

## Recommendation

Consider applying the following changes:

- Introduce a `deadline` parameter in `UniswapNFTManager.sol`'s `permit()` and `_action0Mint()` in the `BoostManager`.
- Introduce a `public` function like Open Zeppelin's [useNonce](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/f281e98c94cf668d13e6d064d3d0b9c173fb8014/contracts/utils/Nonces.sol#L28) that will increase a user's nonce when it's called, thereby cancelling the signatures.

Token owners or operators can approve themselves to a particular token ID.

## Location of Affected Code

File: [ERC721Z.sol]()

```solidity
function approve(address spender, uint256 tokenId) public virtual {
    address owner = ownerOf(tokenId);

    require(msg.sender == owner || isApprovedForAll[owner][msg.sender], "NOT_AUTHORIZED");

    getApproved[tokenId] = spender;

    emit Approval(owner, spender, tokenId);
}
```

## Impact

If the `isApprovedForAll()` status of the user is removed, his self-approval to the `tokenId` via `approve()` still stands, providing a potential approval backdoor.

## Recommendation

Add a check to ensure that owners or users approved for all cannot approve themselves to individual token IDs.

## Team Response

Fixed.

# [L-03] Lender Share Should Not Query Allowance from Owners

## Severity

Low Risk

## Description

In `Lender.sol`'s `transferFrom()`, allowance is only skipped if the sender is granted max approval. As a result, even if the owner attempts to use the `transferFrom()` method on his own tokens, the allowance will still be checked.

## Location of Affected Code

File: [Lender.sol#L321](https://github.com/cryptovash/sammin-core/blob/c49807ae2965cf6d121a10507a43de1d64ba1e70/core/src/Lender.sol#L321)

```solidity
function transferFrom(address from, address to, uint256 shares) external returns (bool) {
    uint256 allowed = allowance[from][msg.sender];
    if (allowed != type(uint256).max) allowance[from][msg.sender] = allowed - shares;
    accrueInterest();
    _transfer(from, to, shares);
    return true;
}
```

## Impact

Allowance is checked and consumed even if the sender is the owner.

## Recommendation

If the `from` address is equal to the `msg.sender`, skip the allowance check.

## Team Response

Fixed.

# [L-04] Missing Check for `tokenId ` Existence Before Returning the `tokenURI`

## Severity

Low Risk

## Description

The `tokenURI` in `BorrowerNFT.sol` overrides ERC721Z's implementation. The implementation does not check that `tokenId` exists and hence will return data for non-existent `tokenId`. This goes contrary to [EIP721](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-721) which states:

```
> /// @notice A distinct Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) for a given asset.
> /// @dev Throws if `_tokenId` is not a valid NFT. URIs are defined in RFC
> ///  3986. The URI may point to a JSON file that conforms to the "ERC721
> ///  Metadata JSON Schema".
> function tokenURI(uint256 _tokenId) external view returns (string);
```

## Location of Affected Code

File: [src/borrower-nft/BorrowerNFT.sol](https://github.com/cryptovash/sammin-core/blob/c49807ae2965cf6d121a10507a43de1d64ba1e70/periphery/src/borrower-nft/BorrowerNFT.sol)

```solidity
function tokenURI(uint256 tokenId) external view override returns (string memory) {
    return URI_SOURCE.uriOf(_borrowerOf(tokenId));
}
```

## Impact

Lack of compliance with the EIP-721 standard and integration issues with NFT marketplaces.

## Recommendation

Consider sticking to the EIP-721 standard.

## Team Response

# [L-05] Usage of Transfer Instead of Call For Native Funds

## Severity

Low Risk

## Description

The contract uses Solidityâ€™s `transfer()` when transferring native tokens in `BadDebtProcessor.sol` and `Liquidator.sol`.
This has some notable shortcomings which can render ETH impossible to transfer.
The transfer will inevitably fail if:

- The gas cost of EVM instructions changes significantly during hard forks (transfer opcode sends a fixed 2300 gas)
- The recipient is a smart contract which does not implement a payable fallback function
- Implements a `payable fallback` function which would incur more than 2300 gas units
- Implements a `payable fallback` function incurring less than 2300 gas units but is called through a proxy that raises the callâ€™s gas usage above 2300

## Location of Affected Code

File: [src/BadDebtProcessor.sol](https://github.com/cryptovash/sammin-core/blob/c49807ae2965cf6d121a10507a43de1d64ba1e70/helpers/src/BadDebtProcessor.sol)

```solidity
>  if (closeFactor == 10000) payable(withdrawFrom).transfer(address(this).balance);
```

File: [src/Liquidator.sol](https://github.com/cryptovash/sammin-core/blob/c49807ae2965cf6d121a10507a43de1d64ba1e70/helpers/src/Liquidator.sol)

```solidity
function liquidate(Borrower borrower, bytes calldata data, uint256 closeFactor, uint40 oracleSeed) external {
    borrower.liquidate(this, data, closeFactor, oracleSeed);
    if (closeFactor == 10000) payable(msg.sender).transfer(address(this).balance);
}
```

## Impact

Inability to receive ETH dossing `uniswapV3FlashCallback()` in BadDebtProcessor.sol and `liquidate()` in `Liquidator.sol`

## Recommendation

Use the low-level `call.value(amount)`Â with the corresponding result check or use the OpenZeppelinÂ `Address.sendValue()`.

It is also recommended to follow the CEI pattern or add a reentrancy guard to the functions as the call opcode can leave a contract vulnerable to reentrancy attacks.

## Team Response

Fixed.

# [L-06] Unnecessary Allowance Buildup in the `UniswapNFTManager`

## Severity

Low Risk

## Description

In `UniswapNFTManager.sol`, `callback()` approves Uniswap NFT to spend amount to burn + 1 by only sending amount to burn as amount desired in the Uniswap NFT increase liquidity calls. This could lead to significant consequences.

## Location of Affected Code

File: [src/managers/UniswapNFTManager.sol](https://github.com/cryptovash/sammin-core/blob/c49807ae2965cf6d121a10507a43de1d64ba1e70/periphery/src/managers/UniswapNFTManager.sol)

```solidity
ERC20 token0 = borrower.TOKEN0();
ERC20 token1 = borrower.TOKEN1();

(uint256 burned0, uint256 burned1, , ) = borrower.uniswapWithdraw(
    lower,
    upper,
    uint128(liquidity),
    address(this)
);

>1 token0.safeApprove(address(UNISWAP_NFT), burned0 + 1);
>2 token1.safeApprove(address(UNISWAP_NFT), burned1 + 1);
UNISWAP_NFT.increaseLiquidity(
    IUniswapPositionNFT.IncreaseLiquidityParams({
        tokenId: tokenId,
>3      amount0Desired: burned0,
>4      amount1Desired: burned1,
        amount0Min: 0,
        amount1Min: 0,
        deadline: block.timestamp
    })
);

token0.safeTransfer(owner, token0.balanceOf(address(this)));
token1.safeTransfer(owner, token1.balanceOf(address(this)));
```

## Impact

The contract has no other way to approve tokens, as a result, there will be a build-up of allowance to Uniswap NFTs in the contract. This means if the NFT gets compromised, the allowance buildup will make it possible to siphon any available tokens from the manager.

Also, with certain tokens (tokens with approval race protection), the extra allowance will cause permanent DOS as the next approval call will require the previous allowance to be 0, which it will not be in this case. See USDT on Ethereum mainnet as an example. Berachain is a relatively new chain, so newly listed tokens may include this design.

## Recommendation

Zero out approvals after operations to be safe, or approve only the needed amount.

## Team Response

Fixed.

# [L-07] The Permit Functionality in `Lender` Could Not Operate with Smart Contract Multisig Wallets

## Severity

Low Risk

## Description

The `Lender::permit()` function only supports `EOA Signature Verification` and does not support `EIP1271`. Hence `Lender::permit()` is not compatible with `smart contract multisig wallets` such as `Gnosis Safe`.

But the `Staking Salmon protocol` supports `EIP1271` in other instances such as in the `BoostManager::_action0Mint()` which calls the `SignatureCheckerLib.isValidSignatureNow()` which supports both the `EOA signature verification and EIP1271`.

## Location of Affected Code

File: [src/Lender.sol](https://github.com/cryptovash/sammin-core/blob/c49807ae2965cf6d121a10507a43de1d64ba1e70/core/src/Lender.sol)

```solidity
// Unchecked because the only math done is incrementing
// the owner's nonce which cannot realistically overflow.
unchecked {
  address recoveredAddress = ecrecover(
      keccak256(
        abi.encodePacked(
            "\x19\x01",
            DOMAIN_SEPARATOR(),
            keccak256(
                abi.encode(
                    keccak256(
                        "Permit(address owner,address spender,uint256 value,uint256 nonce,uint256 deadline)"
                    ),
                    owner,
                    spender,
                    value,
                    nonces[owner]++,
                    deadline
                )
            )
        )
    ),
    v,
    r,
    s
  );

  require(recoveredAddress != address(0) && recoveredAddress == owner, "Stacking Salmon: permit invalid");

  allowance[recoveredAddress][spender] = value;
}
```

## Impact

The `Router::depositWithPermit2()` function calls the `Lender::permit()` function to initially set the allowance to `type(uint256).max` and then calls the `Lender::deposit()` after transferring the assets to the `Lender` contract.

Therefore, the `Router::depositWithPermit2()` functionality will `DoS` for the smart contract multi-sig wallets since the `Lender::permit()` does not support the `EIP1271`.

## Recommendation

Hence it is recommended to implement the `EIP1271` smart contract signature verification in the `Lender::permit()` function to enable the smart contract multisig wallets to work with the `Router::depositWithPermit2()` function.

## Team Response

Fixed.

# [L-08] Usage of `sqrtPriceX96` Spot Price Is Susceptible to Price Manipulation

## Severity

Low Risk

## Description

The `_action0Mint()` function in `BoostManager` calls the `getAmountsForLiquidity()` in `LiquidityAmounts`, to convert the leveraged Liquidity amount to the required token amounts as shown below:

```solidity
(uint160 sqrtPriceX96, , , , , , ) = borrower.UNISWAP_POOL().slot0();
(uint256 needs0, uint256 needs1) = LiquidityAmounts.getAmountsForLiquidity(
    sqrtPriceX96,
    TickMath.getSqrtRatioAtTick(lower),
    TickMath.getSqrtRatioAtTick(upper),
    liquidity
);
```

The `sqrtPriceX96` used here is the `spot price` which is retrieved from `Pool.slot0`. Hence the `sqrtPriceX96` is highly `susceptible to price manipulation`.

## Location of Affected Code

File: [src/managers/BoostManager.sol](https://github.com/cryptovash/sammin-core/blob/c49807ae2965cf6d121a10507a43de1d64ba1e70/periphery/src/managers/BoostManager.sol)

```solidity
(uint160 sqrtPriceX96, , , , , , ) = borrower.UNISWAP_POOL().slot0();
(uint256 needs0, uint256 needs1) = LiquidityAmounts.getAmountsForLiquidity(
    sqrtPriceX96,
    TickMath.getSqrtRatioAtTick(lower),
    TickMath.getSqrtRatioAtTick(upper),
    liquidity
);
```

## Impact

Hence the above issue could result in wrong derived amounts (needs0, needs1) during borrow amount calculations. As a result, the user could end up borrowing amounts of `token1 and token0` which is unfavourable to him. The `seemsLegit` flag derived in the `Borrower::getPrices()` function is used to identify UniswapV3 price manipulation and pause the borrowing accordingly.

But as per the Natspec given in the `Oracle.sol` contract, if the price is manipulated equally across the two adjacent time intervals then the metric will result in 0 hence `seemsLegit` will be true, thus making the `seemsLegit` check ineffective.

## Recommendation

Hence it is recommended to use the `TWAP` price of the `UniswapV3Pool` for the `LiquidityAmounts.getAmountsForLiquidity` call to mitigate the spot price manipulation of UniswapV3Pool. If the protocol is willing to accept this risk, then it is recommended to document this risk factor, thus making the users aware of it.

## Team Response

Acknowledged.

# [L-09] Hardcoded and Potentially Vulnerable Slippage and Deadline Parameters

## Severity

Low Risk

## Description

In `UniswapNFTManager.sol` and `BoostManager.sol`, `increaseLiquidityParams()` and `decreaseLiquidityParams()` have their `minAmounts` hardcoded to 0, and the `deadline` is set as `block.timestamp`. This is dangerous, as it allows for sandwich attacks. The protocol has no control over how much is received from the transaction and how long the transaction spends in the mempool.

## Location of Affected Code

File: [src/managers/UniswapNFTManager.sol](https://github.com/cryptovash/sammin-core/blob/c49807ae2965cf6d121a10507a43de1d64ba1e70/periphery/src/managers/UniswapNFTManager.sol)

```solidity
function callback(bytes calldata data, address owner, uint208) external override returns (uint208 positions) {
      // code
      UNISWAP_NFT.increaseLiquidity(
          IUniswapPositionNFT.IncreaseLiquidityParams({
              tokenId: tokenId,
              amount0Desired: burned0,
              amount1Desired: burned1,
              amount0Min: 0,
              amount1Min: 0,
              deadline: block.timestamp
          })
      );
}

function _withdrawFromNFT(uint256 tokenId, uint128 liquidity, address recipient) private {
      UNISWAP_NFT.decreaseLiquidity(
          IUniswapPositionNFT.DecreaseLiquidityParams({
              tokenId: tokenId,
              liquidity: liquidity,
              amount0Min: 0,
              amount1Min: 0,
              deadline: block.timestamp
          })
      );

      // code
}
```

File: [src/managers/BoostManager.sol](https://github.com/cryptovash/sammin-core/blob/c49807ae2965cf6d121a10507a43de1d64ba1e70/periphery/src/managers/BoostManager.sol)

```solidity
function _withdrawFromUniswapNFT( uint256 tokenId, uint128 liquidity, address recipient ) private returns (uint256 burned0, uint256 burned1) {
      IUniswapPositionNFT.DecreaseLiquidityParams({
          tokenId: tokenId,
          liquidity: liquidity,
          amount0Min: 0,
          amount1Min: 0,
          deadline: block.timestamp
      });

      // code
}
```

## Impact

These make the functions potentially vulnerable to slippage issues or sandwich attacks since the protocol has no control over how many tokens are returned from the call or how long the transaction takes.

## Recommendation

Recommend using more reasonable parameters (e.g. a percentage of `amountIn`). An admin function can be created to always keep this updated.

## Team Response

Fixed.

# [L-10] The `isInUse()` Function Can Provide Wrong Information

## Severity

Low Risk

## Description

The `isInUse()` function queries the borrower's token balance and returns true if the balance is > 0. Depending on how the `isInUse()` function is used by external integrations, the result can easily be manipulated by any user by sending as little as 1 wei of `token0` or `token1` to the borrower.

## Location of Affected Code

File: [src/BorrowerLens.sol](https://github.com/cryptovash/sammin-core/blob/c49807ae2965cf6d121a10507a43de1d64ba1e70/periphery/src/BorrowerLens.sol)

```solidity
function isInUse(Borrower borrower) external view returns (bool, IUniswapV3Pool) {
    IUniswapV3Pool pool = borrower.UNISWAP_POOL();

    if (borrower.getUniswapPositions().length > 0) return (true, pool);
>>  if (borrower.TOKEN0().balanceOf(address(borrower)) > 0) return (true, pool);
>>  if (borrower.TOKEN1().balanceOf(address(borrower)) > 0) return (true, pool);
    if (borrower.LENDER0().borrowBalanceStored(address(borrower)) > 0) return (true, pool);
    if (borrower.LENDER1().borrowBalanceStored(address(borrower)) > 0) return (true, pool);

    return (false, pool);
  }
```

## Impact

A borrower that has no borrow balance stored or no Uniswap position can still be made to be seen as active by depositing at least 1 wei of any of the queried tokens.

## Recommendation

Recommend not relying on `balanceOf()` for information, remove the checks or use a system of internal accounting instead.

## Team Response

Acknowledged.

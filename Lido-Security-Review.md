# 3. About Lido and Lido's Community Staking Module

Lido is a liquid-staking protocol built to make staking as secure and decentralized as possible. As a family of open-source, peer-to-system software tools, Lido is currently deployed and functioning on the Ethereum, Solana, and Polygon blockchain networks.

The Lido protocol is governed by the Lido DAO - an independent collection of contributors, staking enthusiasts and governance participants.

Lido's Community Staking Module is the first permissionless one. To make CSM more attractive to the community stakers, the following features were introduced:

- EL rewards and MEV are smoothened with the other modules (e.g. the Curated Module) so CSM Node Operators could potentially gain more stable rewards that are closer to the average MEV ones;
- A reasonably low bond is targeted for Node Operators so it can cover more prospective operators;
- ETH (stETH) is the only token for bond and rewards without any involvement of other assets;
- Node Operators are provided with more friendly UX and pay less gas fees for on-chain operations;
- Node Operators are supposed to gain more rewards than vanilla solo staking;

# 4. Risk Classification

|        Severity        | Impact: High | Impact: Medium | Impact: Low |
| :--------------------: | :----------: | :------------: | :---------: |
|  **Likelihood: High**  |   Critical   |      High      |   Medium    |
| **Likelihood: Medium** |     High     |     Medium     |     Low     |
|  **Likelihood: Low**   |    Medium    |      Low       |     Low     |

## 4.1 Impact

- **High** - results in a significant risk for the protocolâ€™s overall well-being. Affects all or most users
- **Medium** - results in a non-critical risk for the protocol affects all or only a subset of users, but is still
  unacceptable
- **Low** - losses will be limited but bearable - and covers vectors similar to griefing attacks that can be easily repaired

## 4.2 Likelihood

- **High** - almost certain to happen and highly lucrative for execution by malicious actors
- **Medium** - still relatively likely, although only conditionally possible
- **Low** - requires a unique set of circumstances and poses non-lucrative cost-of-execution to rewards ratio for the actor

# 7. Findings

# [M-01] `CsFeeOracle` Can Be Initialized By Anyone Due To Front-Running

## Submitted By

[Pelz_Dev](https://x.com/Pelz_Dev)

## Severity

Medium Risk

## Description

The `initialize()` function within the `CsFeeOracle.sol` contract is vulnerable to front-running attacks because it is an external function with no access control. This function allows any external account to call it and initialize the contract with arbitrary parameters, potentially resulting in unauthorized initialization.

## Impact

An attacker could front-run the intended owner and initialize the contract with their own parameters. This could lead to unauthorized control over the contract's administrative functions, misdirecting fees, altering consensus mechanisms, or other critical aspects of the contract's behaviour.

## Location of Affected Code

File: [CSFeeOracle.sol#L86](https://github.com/lidofinance/community-staking-module/blob/8ce9441dce1001c93d75d065f051013ad5908976/src/CSFeeOracle.sol#L86)

```solidity
function initialize(
  address admin,
  address feeDistributorContract,
  address consensusContract,
  uint256 consensusVersion,
  uint256 _avgPerfLeewayBP
) external {
  if (admin == address(0)) revert ZeroAdminAddress();

  _grantRole(DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE, admin);

  BaseOracle._initialize(consensusContract, consensusVersion, 0);
  /// @dev _setFeeDistributorContract() reverts if zero address
  _setFeeDistributorContract(feeDistributorContract);
  _setPerformanceLeeway(_avgPerfLeewayBP);
}
```

## Recommendation

Implement access control for the `initialize` function to ensure that only authorized accounts can call it.

## Team Response

Acknowledged, it won't be fixed for the time being.

# [M-02] Loss of Rewards Due to Hardcoded Zero Address as a `_refreral`

## Submitted By

[atharv_181](https://x.com/atharv_181)

## Severity

Medium Risk

## Description

Node Operators won't receive referral rewards for depositing ETH into Lido. When staking ETH with Lido and depositing `stETH` into the bond, the process calls `CSBondCore::_depositETH()` to deposit ETH into Lido. However, since the referral address is passed as zero, no referral rewards are earned.

The Lido Rewards Share Program started a referral initiative to increase participation in staking via Lido. Participants can refer others to Lido, earning a share of rewards based on the staked amounts of those they refer.

Participants can earn referral rewards proportional to the staked amount of those they refer. The exact earnings depend on how much ETH the referred users stake and the duration they keep their assets staked.

Letâ€™s say prior to enrollment, the amount of ETH staked through Participant Aâ€™s products and services is 60,000 ETH and the Committee agreed to a 25% Rewards Share Percentage.

If as a result of the 60,000 ETH stake a middleware usage fee in the amount of 1,000 ETH is programmatically collected, Participant A would receive 250 ETH as their share (25% of 1000 ETH). This reward-sharing continues for each ETH staked, starting from the date each ETH is staked, and generally lasts for 12 months. If Participant A decides to stake additional ETH during this period, each new ETH will also earn rewards for 12 months from the date it was staked.

Hardcoding the referral address to `address(0)`, the reward amount is lost.

## Location of Affected Code

File: [CSBondCore.sol#L125](https://github.com/lidofinance/community-staking-module/blob/develop/src/abstract/CSBondCore.sol#L125)

```solidity
function _depositETH(address from, uint256 nodeOperatorId) internal {
    if (msg.value == 0) return;
    uint256 shares = LIDO.submit{ value: msg.value }({
        _referal: address(0)
    });
    _increaseBond(nodeOperatorId, shares);
    emit BondDepositedETH(nodeOperatorId, from, msg.value);
}
```

## Recommendation

Referrals should be distributed to all node operators proportionally to bond shares.

## Team Response

Acknowledged, it won't be fixed for the time being.

# [L-01] Fee-on-Transfer Tokens Can Cause Accounting Discrepancies in Asset Recovery Functions

## Submitted By

[bloqarl](https://x.com/TheBlockChainer)

## Severity

Low Risk

## Description

The `AssetRecovererLib` library, which is used by `CSAccounting`, `CSFeeDistributor`, and potentially other contracts inheriting from `AssetRecoverer`, contains a `recoverERC20()` function that is vulnerable to fee-on-transfer token accounting issues. This function assumes that the full amount specified will be transferred, which may not be the case for tokens that implement a fee-on-transfer mechanism.

## Impact

If a fee-on-transfer token is recovered using this function, the actual amount transferred will be less than the amount specified. This discrepancy could lead to:

- Incorrect accounting of recovered assets
- Potential loss of funds if the contract's balance is used for future calculations or operations
- Inconsistencies between on-chain state and off-chain records
- Misleading event emissions, as the emitted amount may not reflect the actual transferred amount

While the impact is generally low due to the restricted access of these functions (only callable by a recoverer role), it still presents a risk, especially if these contracts interact with or recover a wide range of tokens in the future.

## Proof of Concept

1. Assume a fee-on-transfer token that takes a 1% fee on each transfer.
2. The contract has a balance of 1000 of these tokens.
3. A recoverer calls recoverERC20 with an amount of 1000.
4. Only 990 tokens are actually transferred due to the fee.
5. The ERC20Recovered event is emitted with an amount of 1000, which is incorrect.

## Location of Affected Code

File: [AssetRecovererLib.sol](https://github.com/lidofinance/community-staking-module/blob/8ce9441dce1001c93d75d065f051013ad5908976/src/lib/AssetRecovererLib.sol)

```solidity
function recoverERC20(address token, uint256 amount) external {
    IERC20(token).safeTransfer(msg.sender, amount);
    emit IAssetRecovererLib.ERC20Recovered(token, msg.sender, amount);
}
```

## Recommendation

To mitigate this issue, implement a balance check before and after the transfer to determine the actual amount transferred:

```solidity
function recoverERC20(address token, uint256 amount) external {
    uint256 balanceBefore = IERC20(token).balanceOf(address(this));
    IERC20(token).safeTransfer(msg.sender, amount);
    uint256 balanceAfter = IERC20(token).balanceOf(address(this));
    uint256 actualAmountTransferred = balanceBefore - balanceAfter;
    emit IAssetRecovererLib.ERC20Recovered(token, msg.sender, actualAmountTransferred);
}
```

## Team Response

Acknowledged, the amount in the event properly reflects the amount of tokens transferred from the contract.

# [L-02] Potential Overflow on `_lock()` Method

## Submitted By

[bloqarl](https://x.com/TheBlockChainer)

## Severity

Low Risk

## Description

There is a potential for overflow in the `_lock()` function from the `CSBondLock` contract. The unchecked block in `_lock()` is problematic because it adds the new amount to any existing locked amount.

Even if individual calls don't use extremely large values, repeated calls could potentially lead to an overflow over time.

## Impact

The `lockBondETH()` function in `CSModule` (which calls `_lock()` in `CSBondLock`) is indeed restricted to `onlyCSM`, meaning it can only be called by the CSM contract itself. This significantly reduces the risk of malicious exploitation. However, there is still theoretical risk even in unintentional circumstances.

## Location of Affected Code

File [CSBondLock.sol](https://github.com/lidofinance/community-staking-module/blob/8ce9441dce1001c93d75d065f051013ad5908976/src/abstract/CSBondLock.sol)

```solidity
function _lock(uint256 nodeOperatorId, uint256 amount) internal {
  ...
  unchecked {
      if ($.bondLock[nodeOperatorId].retentionUntil > block.timestamp) {
          amount += $.bondLock[nodeOperatorId].amount;
      }
      _changeBondLock({
          nodeOperatorId: nodeOperatorId,
          amount: amount,
          retentionUntil: block.timestamp + $.bondLockRetentionPeriod
      });
  }
}
```

## Recommendation

Consider applying either of the following mitigations:

- Add an explicit check for overflow:

```diff
if ($.bondLock[nodeOperatorId].retentionUntil > block.timestamp) {
+   require(amount <= type(uint256).max - $.bondLock[nodeOperatorId].amount, "Lock amount too high");
    amount += $.bondLock[nodeOperatorId].amount;
}
```

- Add an upper limit to the amount that can be locked, based on realistic maximum values for the protocol:

```diff
if ($.bondLock[nodeOperatorId].retentionUntil > block.timestamp) {
+   require(amount <= MAX_LOCKABLE_AMOUNT, "Lock amount exceeds maximum");
    amount += $.bondLock[nodeOperatorId].amount;
}
```

## Team Response

Will be fixed, the `unchecked` block will be removed to ensure native solidity revert in case of overflow.

# 4. Risk Classification

|        Severity        | Impact: High | Impact: Medium | Impact: Low |
| :--------------------: | :----------: | :------------: | :---------: |
|  **Likelihood: High**  |   Critical   |      High      |   Medium    |
| **Likelihood: Medium** |     High     |     Medium     |     Low     |
|  **Likelihood: Low**   |    Medium    |      Low       |     Low     |

## 4.1 Impact

- **High** - results in a significant risk for the protocolâ€™s overall well-being. Affects all or most users
- **Medium** - results in a non-critical risk for the protocol affects all or only a subset of users, but is still
  unacceptable
- **Low** - losses will be limited but bearable - and covers vectors similar to griefing attacks that can be easily repaired

## 4.2 Likelihood

- **High** - almost certain to happen and highly lucrative for execution by malicious actors
- **Medium** - still relatively likely, although only conditionally possible
- **Low** - requires a unique set of circumstances and poses non-lucrative cost-of-execution to rewards ratio for the actor

# 5. Security Review Summary

The security review lasted 4 days with a total of 128 hours dedicated to the audit by four researchers from the Shieldify team.

The audit report identified several medium-severity issues, including potential fee evasion, stuck funds in contracts, and incorrect imports, as well as a low-severity issue with transactions failing due to low gas limits.

The protocol's team has done a great job providing support and responses to all of the questions that the Shieldify researchers had.

# [M-01] RoutingFee Can Be Set to `1 Wei` to Evade Fees

## Severity

Medium Risk

## Description

When using the protocol, the user will call `GlueXRouter.swap()` and set the `RouteDescription` as the parameter. The user can control the routing fee and can set it to 1 wei to evade fees.

```solidity
struct RouteDescription {
    IERC20 inputToken;
    IERC20 outputToken;
    address payable inputReceiver;
    address payable outputReceiver;
    uint256 inputAmount;
    uint256 outputAmount;
@>  uint256 routingFee;
    uint256 effectiveOutputAmount;
    uint256 minOutputAmount;
    bool isPermit2;
}
```

The `routingFee` cannot be 0, but it can be 1 wei.

```solidity
function swap(
    Executor executor,
@>  RouteDescription calldata desc,
    Interaction[] calldata interactions
) external payable returns (uint256 finalOutputAmount) {
    // code

    require(desc.routingFee > 0, "Negative routing fee");

    // code
}
```

## Location of Affected Code

File: [contracts/GluexRouter.sol#L35](https://github.com/gluexprotocol/gluex_router/blob/1df4eaef9c3063a3171961e1f8bba3eb83c6b7e1/contracts/GluexRouter.sol#L35)

File: [contracts/GluexRouter.sol#L90](https://github.com/gluexprotocol/gluex_router/blob/1df4eaef9c3063a3171961e1f8bba3eb83c6b7e1/contracts/GluexRouter.sol#L90)

## Impact

Users can evade fees.

## Recommendation

Consider setting the fee at a base percent `(maybe 0.1 - 1%)` and every time a `swap()` happens, a percentage of the fees will go directly to the fee treasury.

## Team Response

Acknowledged, the risk will be mitigated off-chain, with access granted only to a select group of users.

# [M-02] Excess `msg.value` Can Be Stuck In The `Executor.sol` Contract

## Severity

Medium Risk

## Description

The `swap()` function is payable, which means it can allow native tokens.

```solidity
function swap(
    IExecutor executor,
    RouteDescription calldata desc,
    Interaction[] calldata interactions
) external payable returns (uint256 finalOutputAmount) {
```

Native tokens will be sent to the executor through the low-level call:

```solidity
IExecutor(executor).executeRoute{value: msg.value}(interactions);
```

If users intend to use the `swap()` functionality without native tokens and accidentally add native tokens, it will be stuck in the Executor contract.

Since the Executor contract has no access control, anyone can withdraw funds from that contract through the `executeRoute()` function.

## Location of Affected Code

File: [contracts/GluexRouter.sol#L141](https://github.com/gluexprotocol/gluex_router/blob/1df4eaef9c3063a3171961e1f8bba3eb83c6b7e1/contracts/GluexRouter.sol#L141)

## Impact

Native tokens will be stuck in the contract.

## Recommendation

If the input token is not a native token, make sure `msg.value` is not used.

```diff
function swap(
    IExecutor executor,
    RouteDescription calldata desc,
    Interaction[] calldata interactions
) external payable returns (uint256 finalOutputAmount) {
    // code

    if (!isNativeTokenInput) {
+       require(msg.value == 0, "Msg.value stuck in contract");
        inputToken.safeTransferFromUniversal(
            msg.sender,
            desc.inputReceiver,
            desc.inputAmount,
            desc.isPermit2
        );`
    }

    // code
}
```

## Team Response

Fixed.

# [M-03] `desc.effectiveOutputAmount` Can Be Set At a Lower Amount to Pay a Lesser Routing Fee

## Severity

Medium Risk

## Description

When calculating fees, fees are only taken into account after the swap if the output amount is greater than the `effectiveOutputAmount`.

```solidity
function swap(
    IExecutor executor,
    RouteDescription calldata desc,
    Interaction[] calldata interactions
) external payable returns (uint256 finalOutputAmount) {
    // code

    // Get output amount including positive slippage
    uint256 routeOutputAmount = outputBalanceAfter - outputBalanceBefore;

    if (routeOutputAmount > desc.effectiveOutputAmount + desc.routingFee) {
        // User get total amount incl positive slippage minus routing fee
        finalOutputAmount = routeOutputAmount - desc.routingFee;
    } else {
        // Routing fee should only be above the effective output expected by the user
        if (routeOutputAmount > desc.effectiveOutputAmount) {
            finalOutputAmount = desc.effectiveOutputAmount;
        } else {
            // If execution is lower than expected (negative slippage), then no routing fee
            finalOutputAmount = routeOutputAmount;
        }
    }

    // code
}
```

In cases of swap where the liquidity is extremely high and the swap is small, slippage can be set to the lowest (1) without much issues, which can bypass the routingFee since `routeOutputAmount < desc.effectiveOutputAmount`.

## Location of Affected Code

File: [contracts/GluexRouter.sol#L152-L165](https://github.com/gluexprotocol/gluex_router/blob/1df4eaef9c3063a3171961e1f8bba3eb83c6b7e1/contracts/GluexRouter.sol#L152-L165)

## Impact

Users can evade fees.

## Recommendation

Consider setting the fee as a percentage of the `routeOutputAmount`, or a flat fee depending on how big the swap is.

## Team Response

Acknowledged, the risk will be mitigated off-chain, with access granted only to a select group of users.

# [M-04] Imports Cannot Be Read Because of Incorrect File Location

## Severity

Medium Risk

## Description

When testing the deployment of the contracts in `Remix`, there is an error in imports, the file location is incorrect in the import statement. `./` should be used instead of directly calling it from `utils/EthReceive.sol`

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: GPL-2.0-or-later
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

@> import {EthReceiver} from "utils/EthReceiver.sol";
@> import {Interaction} from "base/RouterStructs.sol";
@> import {IExecutor} from "interfaces/IExecutor.sol";

/**
 * @title GenericExecutor
 * @notice Executor that executes an array of interactions
 */
```

Tested in Remix, imports cannot be read because of incorrect file location.

## Location of Affected Code

File: [contracts/GluexRouter.sol#L4-L6](https://github.com/gluexprotocol/gluex_router/blob/1df4eaef9c3063a3171961e1f8bba3eb83c6b7e1/contracts/GluexRouter.sol#L4-L6)

## Impact

The contract cannot be deployed.

## Recommendation

Add `./` to the imports.

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: GPL-2.0-or-later
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

import {EthReceiver} from "./utils/EthReceiver.sol";

# [M-05] Tokens Will Get Stuck In The Executor In Certain Instances Of Swaps

## Severity

Medium Risk

## Description

Most swaps uses the ExactToken -> Token structure, which means that the input amount is exactly what is sent and the output amount varies on the liquidity. The Token -> ExactToken structure also exists, whereby the output amount is fixed but the input amount varies.

In UniswapV2, `swapTokensForExactTokens()` is a function that swaps an input token for the exact output token amount.

In this protocol, when `swap()` is called, the whole input amount will be sent to the Executor contract (desc.inputReceiver is the executor contract).

```solidity
 if (!isNativeTokenInput) {
    inputToken.safeTransferFromUniversal(
        msg.sender,
        desc.inputReceiver,
        desc.inputAmount,
        desc.isPermit2
    );
}
```

If such `swapTokensForExactTokens()` functions are used, the remaining input tokens will be stuck in the Executor contract. If the caller does not know about this, then he may lose out on some tokens.

Run with `forge test --fork-url https://rpc.ankr.com/eth -vv --mt testStuckTokens`, output will be:

```solidity

[PASS] testStuckTokens() (gas: 276552)
Logs:
  Setup DONE
  EXECUTOR WETH BALANCE Before:  0

  EXECUTOR WETH BALANCE After:  21364774417361964
  EXECUTOR USDC BALANCE After:  0
  0
```

Note that the executor starts with 0 WETH and 0 USDC, and the user starts with 1e18 WETH.

- User calls swapTokensForExactTokens and sets output amount to be 3900 USDC and input as 1e18 WETH
- Since WETH is currently above >3900, the executor has ~21364774417361964 (0.02136 ETH) left over inside.

## Impact

Tokens will be stuck in the executor (and eventually can be stolen by directly calling the executor to approve funds to the malicious caller).

## Recommendation

Sweep funds from the executor to the router after all the interactions have been completed. Otherwise, ensure that user's understand the risks of using the `swap()` function and ensure that users have an interaction that sweeps the funds from the executor before `swap()` is completed.

## Team Response

Acknowledged, Version 1 of the GlueX Router is designed for "exact input" routes only, and the public documentation will be updated to reflect this.

# [L-01] Low Gas Limits Could Stuck Transactions for Certain Recipients

## Severity

Low Risk

## Description

The hardcoded `5_000` gas limit is not high enough for the protocol to be able to receive and distribute rewards.

It is not good to have the gas limit fixed. This will cause the function to revert if insufficient gas is used. Even in the solidity documentation, we can see this warning for the gas option:

> It is best to avoid relying on hardcoded gas values in your smart contract code, regardless of whether the state is read from or written to, as this can have many pitfalls. Also, access to gas might change in the future.

```solidity
function uniTransfer(
    IERC20 token,
    address payable to,
    uint256 amount
) internal {
    if (amount > 0) {
        if (address(token) == _nativeToken) {
            if (address(this).balance < amount) revert InsufficientBalance();

            // solhint-disable-next-line avoid-low-level-calls
@>          (bool success, ) = to.call{ value: amount, gas: _RAW_CALL_GAS_LIMIT }("");

            // code
        }
    }
}
```

## Recommendation

Consider removing or increasing the hardcoded `5_000` gas limit in [GluexRouter::uniTransfer()]. A possible approach is to implement a setter function for the `_RAW_CALL_GAS_LIMIT`.

# [L-02] Missing Deadline Check in the `GluexRouter.swap()` Function

## Severity

Low Risk

## Description

The `swap()` function in the `GluexRouter.sol` contract executes a route, delegating all calls encoded interactions to the `executor`.

However, this function does not include a **deadline check** to ensure that the swap is executed within a specific time frame.

This omission could expose the contract to certain risks, such as stale transactions that are executed later than intended.

Although the slippage check helps mitigate the impact of price changes, swaps executed without a time limit could still be exposed to high market volatility over a longer period. If market conditions change drastically, the userâ€™s transaction could be negatively impacted.

## Impact

Users who send more ETH than required will not receive a refund for the excess amount.

## Location of Affected Code

File: [contracts/GluexRouter.sol#L88](https://github.com/gluexprotocol/gluex_router/blob/1df4eaef9c3063a3171961e1f8bba3eb83c6b7e1/contracts/GluexRouter.sol#L88)

## Recommendation

We recommend adding a **deadline parameter** to the `swap()` function to ensure that transactions are executed within a specified time frame. This will give users additional protection against market volatility and stale transactions.

```diff
function swap(
        IExecutor executor,
        RouteDescription calldata desc,
        Interaction[] calldata interactions
+       uint256 deadline
)
    external
    payable
    returns (
        uint256 finalOutputAmount
) {
+   if (deadline < block.timestamp) revert DeadlineExpired();
}
```

# [I-01] Nothing Happens in the `uniTransfer()` Function When the Amount Parameter Is Equal to Zero

## Severity

Info

## Description

In the uniTransfer function, if the amount parameter is equal to zero, nothing happens and the transaction is executed successfully.

File: [contracts/GluexRouter.sol#L191](https://github.com/gluexprotocol/gluex_router/blob/1df4eaef9c3063a3171961e1f8bba3eb83c6b7e1/contracts/GluexRouter.sol#L191)

```solidity
function uniTransfer(
    IERC20 token,
    address payable to,
    uint256 amount
) internal {
@>  if (amount > 0) {
        if (address(token) == _nativeToken) {
            if (address(this).balance < amount)
                revert InsufficientBalance();

            // solhint-disable-next-line avoid-low-level-calls
            (bool success, ) = to.call{
                value: amount,
                gas: _RAW_CALL_GAS_LIMIT
            }("");

            if (!success) revert NativeTransferFailed();
        } else {
            token.safeTransfer(to, amount);
        }
@>  }
}
```

## Recommendation

We recommend reverting the transaction when the amount is zero.

# [H-01] Protocol Can Receive Zero Shares Despite Surplus

## Severity

High Risk

## Description

The contract computes `protocolShare` by subtracting `partnerShare` from `surplus` and adding a portion of `slippage` based on `protocolSlippageShare`. However, there is no enforcement of a minimum threshold for `protocolSlippageShare`, allowing it to be zero or arbitrarily small. This may result in the protocol receiving negligible or no compensation from a transaction that generates a valid surplus and slippage, undermining protocol sustainability and revenue assumptions.

## Location of Affected Code

File: [router_v1/GluexRouter.sol#L230-L232](https://github.com/gluexprotocol/gluex_router_contract/blob/9c754a3985fa32b72d847c88c83575f29a86bc01/router_v1/GluexRouter.sol#L230-L232)

```solidity
function swap(
    IExecutor executor,
    RouteDescription calldata desc,
    Interaction[] calldata interactions
) external payable returns (uint256 finalOutputAmount, uint256 surplus, uint256 slippage) {
  // code
  uint256 protocolSurplus = surplus - partnerShare;
  uint256 protocolSlippage = (slippage * desc.protocolSlippageShare) / 10000;
  uint256 protocolShare = protocolSurplus + protocolSlippage;
  // code
}
```

## Impact

The protocol may be deprived of its expected revenue from transaction surplus and slippage, weakening its economic model and ability to fund operations or rewards.

## Recommendation

Enforce a minimum threshold for `protocolSlippageShare` to ensure consistent protocol compensation.

```diff
+ require(desc.protocolSlippageShare >= MIN_SHARE, "protocol share too low");
```

## Team Response

Fixed.

# [H-02] Partner Can Receive Zero Share Despite Surplus

## Severity

High Risk

## Description

The contract calculates `partnerShare` based on the `partnerSurplusShare` and `partnerSlippageShare` percentages provided in the `desc` struct. However, it does not enforce a minimum threshold for these shares, allowing them to be set to zero or an insignificantly low value. This undermines the expected incentive mechanism for partners who facilitate transactions. Without enforcing a floor, a misconfigured or malicious `desc` input can completely exclude a partner from their entitled earnings even when surplus or slippage exists.

## Location of Affected Code

File: [router_v1/GluexRouter.sol#L223-L227](https://github.com/gluexprotocol/gluex_router_contract/blob/9c754a3985fa32b72d847c88c83575f29a86bc01/router_v1/GluexRouter.sol#L223-L227)

```solidity
function swap(
    IExecutor executor,
    RouteDescription calldata desc,
    Interaction[] calldata interactions
) external payable returns (uint256 finalOutputAmount, uint256 surplus, uint256 slippage) {
  // code
  if (surplus > 0 || slippage > 0) {
    uint256 partnerSurplus = (surplus * desc.partnerSurplusShare) / 10000;
    uint256 partnerSlippage = (slippage * desc.partnerSlippageShare) / 10000;
    uint256 partnerShare = partnerSurplus + partnerSlippage;
  }
  // code
}
```

## Impact

Partners may receive no compensation for their participation, reducing incentives for integration and potentially breaching contractual agreements with third-party stakeholders.

## Recommendation

Enforce a minimum threshold for `partnerSurplusShare` and `partnerSlippageShare` to guarantee non-zero rewards.

```diff
+ require(desc.partnerSurplusShare >= MIN_SHARE && desc.partnerSlippageShare >= MIN_SHARE, "partner share too low");
```

## Team Response

Acknowledged.

# [H-03] Swap Can Execute After Deadline Expires

## Severity

High Risk

## Description

The `swap()` function lacks a deadline enforcement mechanism, despite the [official documentation](https://docs.gluex.xyz/gluex-apis/router-api/smart-contracts/Router#reverts) explicitly requiring that swaps revert if the current block timestamp exceeds a specified deadline.

> Reverts:
> Deadline passed: If the block timestamp exceeds the deadline.

This missing check allows transactions to be mined at any time in the future, potentially after market conditions have changed or slippage assumptions are no longer valid. Such behavior undermines user protection against stale or manipulated execution.

## Location of Affected Code

File: [router_v1/GluexRouter.sol#L167-L171](https://github.com/gluexprotocol/gluex_router_contract/blob/9c754a3985fa32b72d847c88c83575f29a86bc01/router_v1/GluexRouter.sol#L167-L171)

## Impact

Attackers or miners can intentionally delay transaction inclusion and front-run or back-run users, leading to unfair execution prices or failed economic assumptions. This introduces both financial and reputational risk.

## Recommendation

Add a deadline check at the start of the swap function to revert if the current timestamp exceeds the allowed window.

```diff
+ require(block.timestamp <= desc.deadline, "deadline passed");
```

## Team Response

Acknowledged.

# [M-01] `_MAX_FEE`Can be Greater Than `100` Percentage

## Severity

Medium Risk

## Description

The `setMaxFee()` functions allow the `treasury` to update `_MAX_FEE`. The `setMaxFee()` permits values exceeding 100% (i.e., >10000 basis points), which can lead to economically irrational fees.

## Location of Affected Code

File: [router_v1/GluexRouter.sol#L392](https://github.com/gluexprotocol/gluex_router_contract/blob/9c754a3985fa32b72d847c88c83575f29a86bc01/router_v1/GluexRouter.sol#L392)

```solidity
function setMaxFee(uint256 maxFee) external onlyTreasury {
    _MAX_FEE = maxFee;
}
```

## Impact

The protocol may charge excessive or invalid fees, leading to transaction reverts, economic failure, or user loss of trust.

## Recommendation

Enforce that `maxFee` does not exceed `10000`

```diff
function setMaxFee(uint256 maxFee) external onlyTreasury {
+   require(maxFee <= 10000, "max fee cannot exceed 100%");
    _MAX_FEE = maxFee;
}
```

## Team Response

Fixed.

# [M-02] `_MIN_FEE` Can be Greater Than `_MAX_FEE`

## Severity

Medium Risk

## Description

The `setMinFee()` function does not ensure that the new minimum is less than or equal to `_MAX_FEE`, allowing a state where `_MIN_FEE > _MAX_FEE`. This misconfiguration can render the fee logic unusable, result in user lockout, or violate economic assumptions.

## Location of Affected Code

File: [router_v1/GluexRouter.sol#L401](https://github.com/gluexprotocol/gluex_router_contract/blob/9c754a3985fa32b72d847c88c83575f29a86bc01/router_v1/GluexRouter.sol#L401)

```solidity
function setMinFee(uint256 minFee) external onlyTreasury {
    _MIN_FEE = minFee;
}
```

## Impact

Incorrect fee bounds also break any logic that assumes valid fee ranges.

## Recommendation

Ensure that `minFee` does not exceed `_MAX_FEE`.

```diff
function setMinFee(uint256 minFee) external onlyTreasury {
+   require(minFee <= _MAX_FEE, "min fee cannot exceed max fee");
    _MIN_FEE = minFee;
}
```

## Team Response

Fixed.

# [L-01] Missing Zero Address Validation

## Severity

Low Risk

## Description

The contracts were found to be setting immutable addresses without proper validations for zero addresses.

## Location of Affected Code

File: [router_v1/GluexRouter.sol#L106](https://github.com/gluexprotocol/gluex_router_contract/blob/9c754a3985fa32b72d847c88c83575f29a86bc01/router_v1/GluexRouter.sol#L106)

```solidity
constructor(address gluexTreasury, address nativeToken) {
    // Ensure the addresses are not zero
    checkZeroAddress(gluexTreasury);

    _gluexTreasury = gluexTreasury;
@>> _nativeToken = nativeToken;
}
```

## Impact

If address type parameters do not include a zero-address check, contract functionality may become unavailable.

## Recommendation

Add a zero address validation to all the functions where addresses are being set.

## Team Response

Acknowledged.

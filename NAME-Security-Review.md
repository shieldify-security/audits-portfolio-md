# 2. Disclaimer

This security review does not guarantee bulletproof protection against a hack or exploit. Smart contracts are a novel technological feat with many known and unknown risks. The protocol, which this report is intended for, indemnifies Shieldify Security against any responsibility for any misbehavior, bugs, or exploits affecting the audited code during any part of the project's life cycle. It is also pivotal to acknowledge that modifications made to the audited code, including fixes for the issues described in this report, may introduce new problems and necessitate additional auditing.

# 4. Risk Classification

|        Severity        | Impact: High | Impact: Medium | Impact: Low |
| :--------------------: | :----------: | :------------: | :---------: |
|  **Likelihood: High**  |   Critical   |      High      |   Medium    |
| **Likelihood: Medium** |     High     |     Medium     |     Low     |
|  **Likelihood: Low**   |    Medium    |      Low       |     Low     |

## 4.1 Impact

- **High** - results in a significant risk for the protocol’s overall well-being. Affects all or most users
- **Medium** - results in a non-critical risk for the protocol affects all or only a subset of users, but is still
  unacceptable
- **Low** - losses will be limited but bearable - and covers vectors similar to griefing attacks that can be easily repaired

## 4.2 Likelihood

- **High** - almost certain to happen and highly lucrative for execution by malicious actors
- **Medium** - still relatively likely, although only conditionally possible
- **Low** - requires a unique set of circumstances and poses non-lucrative cost-of-execution to rewards ratio for the actor

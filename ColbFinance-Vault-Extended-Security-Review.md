# [M-01] Vault Tokens Can Be Trapped If User Is Removed from Whitelist

## Severity

Medium Risk

## Description

When `onlyWhitelistTransfer == true`, the `_beforeTokenTransfer()` hook blocks transfers **to or from** any address not on the whitelist.

If a user is removed from the whitelist after claiming tokens, they can no longer:

* Transfer their vault tokens
* Call `requestWithdraw()`, which internally transfers tokens to `address(this)`

This results in a permanent lock of the user’s funds.

## Location of Affected Code

```solidity
function _beforeTokenTransfer(...) internal override {
    // code
    if (onlyWhitelistTransfer) {
        bool can = (whitelist.contains(from) || from == address(0) || from == address(this))
                && (whitelist.contains(to) || to == address(0) || to == address(this));
        if (!can) revert OnlyWhitelistUserCanTransfer();
    }
}
```

```solidity
function requestWithdraw(uint256 amount) external whenNotPaused {
    address user = msg.sender;
    uint256 userBalance = balanceOf(user);

    if (userBalance < amount) revert InsufficientAmount();

    _transfer(user, address(this), amount);

    uint256 index = nextWithdrawalId++;
    withdraws[index] = WithdrawInfo(
        user,
        uint32(block.timestamp),
        false,
        true,
        amount
    );

    usersWithdraw[user].push(index);
    withdrawToProcess.push(index);

    if (usersWithdraw[user].length >= MAX_PENDING_REQUESTS)
        revert TooManyWithdrawals();

    factory.emitRequestWithdraw(user, amount, index);
}
```

## Recommendation

Еxclude `address(this)` from `from`-side whitelist check to allow `requestWithdraw()` even for non-whitelisted users

## Team Response

Acknowledged.

# [L-01] Incorrect Amount Emitted in `emitCancelDeposit()` Event During `withdraw()` Function

## Severity

Low Risk

## Description

In the `Vault.withdraw(uint256 amount)` function, when a user withdraws tokens before the investment period ends, the contract processes multiple individual deposits to fulfil the total withdrawal amount. However, during this process, the contract emits the `emitCancelDeposit()` event using the total withdrawal amount (`amount`) for every deposit ID that is partially or fully used to fulfil the withdrawal.

This results in event logs that overstate the withdrawn amount per deposit, leading to inaccurate off-chain indexing or broken data consistency in systems relying on event logs (e.g. analytics dashboards or custom dApps).

Importantly, this bug does not affect internal contract accounting or on-chain correctness. It only impacts off-chain consumers of event logs.

**Example scenario that shows the bug:**

1. A user, Alice, has 3 deposits of 33 tokens each.
2. Alice calls `withdraw(90)` - the contract deducts 30 tokens from each deposit.
3. The function emits:

```solidity
emitCancelDeposit(..., ..., depositIdX, 90);
```

For each deposit ID, `90` tokens are reported instead of the actual `30` deducted from that specific deposit.

This creates the false appearance (in off-chain logs) that Alice was refunded 90 tokens per deposit, totalling 270 tokens.

If off-chain systems rely on these logs for state sync or accounting (e.g., dashboards, reward calculation scripts), they may assume incorrect values and produce invalid results.

## Location of Affected Code:

File: [contracts/vault/Vault.sol#L563](https://github.com/COLB-DEV/SmartContracts/blob/d569a17dfdf96fc029d2664beafa3dd1a54495fc/contracts/vault/Vault.sol#L563)

```solidity
/// @dev Only allowed before the investment period ends. Early withdrawal fee may apply.
/// @param amount The amount of deposited tokens to withdraw.
function withdraw(uint256 amount) external whenNotPaused {
    // code

    for (uint256 i = count; i > 0; i--) {
        uint256 id = userIds[i - 1];
        DepositInfo storage deposit = deposits[id];

        if (deposit.amount == 0 || deposit.processed || deposit.reimboursed)
            continue;

        uint256 depositAmount = deposit.amount;

        uint256 amountToDeduct = remainder > depositAmount
            ? depositAmount
            : remainder;

        deposit.amount = depositAmount - amountToDeduct;
        remainder -= amountToDeduct;

        if (deposit.amount == 0) {
            deposit.reimboursed = true;
            // find process index based on the deposit id
            uint256 processId = _findIndex(depositToProcess, id);
            // remove the deposit process id
            _removeAtIndex(depositToProcess, processId);
            // remove the fully processed deposit from user's array
            removeUserDeposit(user, id);
        }

        factory.emitCancelDeposit(msg.sender, deposit.sender, id, amount); //@note amount is the entire user withdrawal request, not the per-deposit deduction (amountToDeduct).

        if (remainder == 0) break;
    }

    // code
}
```

## Recommendation

Update the emitted value in the loop to reflect the actual amount deducted from each deposit:

```diff
- factory.emitCancelDeposit(msg.sender, deposit.sender, id, amount);
+ factory.emitCancelDeposit(msg.sender, deposit.sender, id, amountToDeduct);
```

Fixed.

# [L-02] Vault ID Used Before Mmitting Event - Off By One Risk

## Severity

Low Risk

## Description

In the `deploy()` function of the `VaultFactory` contract, the vault ID is incremented after being used to store the new vault address in the `vaults` mapping.

However, the `VaultDeployed` event is emitted using the incremented value (`vaultId`), which leads to a mismatch between:

* The `vaultId` value **emitted** in the event, and
* The key in the `vaults` mapping under which the new vault address is stored.

This introduces off-chain data integrity issues for indexers, dashboards or UIs relying on `vaultId` - vault address mapping via the event logs. Nothing major.

## Location of Affected Code

File: [contracts/vault/VaultFactory.sol#L151](https://github.com/COLB-DEV/SmartContracts/blob/d569a17dfdf96fc029d2664beafa3dd1a54495fc/contracts/vault/VaultFactory.sol#L151)

```solidity
function deploy(
    string calldata name,
    string calldata symbol,
    address token,
    uint256 minDepositByUser,
    uint256 minTotalDeposit,
    uint256 maxDepositByUser,
    uint256 maxTotalDeposit,
    uint256 investmentEnd
) external onlyRole(OPERATOR_ROLE) returns (address) {
    // code

    uint256 _vaultId = vaultId;

    vaults[_vaultId] = address(newVault);
    isVault[address(newVault)] = true;
    vaultId++;

    emit VaultDeployed(msg.sender, address(newVault), vaultId); //@note emits incremented ID

    return address(newVault);
}
```

## Recommendation

Emit the correct vault ID from the event, using the unincremented `_vaultId` value:

```solidity
emit VaultDeployed(msg.sender, address(newVault), _vaultId);  // correct ID
```

## Team Response

Fixed.

# [L-03] Operator Has Full Control Over Mint vs. Reimburse - Relying Entirely on Ratio Bounds

## Severity

Low Risk

## Description

The `processDeposit()` function allows the operator to manually input both `amountMinted` and `amountReimbursed` for a deposit. While ratio bounds (`minRatio` and `maxRatio`) are enforced, the contract does not check that the sum of `amountMinted + amountReimbursed` matches the original deposit amount.

This opens the door for value mismatches where:

* Some deposit value remains unaccounted (ghost value).
* The user receives fewer tokens than expected.

## Location of Affected Code:

File: [contracts/vault/Vault.sol#L411](https://github.com/COLB-DEV/SmartContracts/blob/d569a17dfdf96fc029d2664beafa3dd1a54495fc/contracts/vault/Vault.sol#L411)

```solidity
function processDeposit(
    uint256 processIndex,
    uint256 amountMinted,
    uint256 amountReimbursed
) external onlyRole(factory.OPERATOR_ROLE()) whenNotPaused {
    if (block.timestamp <= investmentEnd)
        revert InvestmentPeriodNotFinish();
    // If we process during a batch, the calculations would be incorrect
    if (inBatchProcess) revert BatchNotFinished();

    uint256 indexDeposit = depositToProcess[processIndex];
    DepositInfo storage deposit = deposits[indexDeposit];
    uint256 amountDeposited = deposit.amount;

    // ratio calculation prevents errors in share distribution
    uint256 currentRatio = (amountMinted * BASE_RATIO) / amountDeposited;

    if (currentRatio < minRatio) revert UnderflowRatio();
    if (currentRatio > maxRatio) revert OverflowRatio();

    _mint(address(this), amountMinted);
    _processDeposit(indexDeposit, amountMinted, amountReimbursed);
    _removeAtIndex(depositToProcess, processIndex);
}
```

## Recommendation

Enforce a value-preserving invariant:

```solidity
require(amountMinted + amountReimbursed == deposit.amount, "Value mismatch");
```

# [I-01] Missing Validation on `investmentEnd()` in `VaultFactory` Allows Dead-On-Arrival Vaults

## Severity

Informational Risk

## Description

The `deploy()` function in `VaultFactory` accepts `investmentEnd` as a constructor argument:

```solidity
function deploy(
    // code
    uint256 investmentEnd
) external onlyRole(OPERATOR_ROLE) returns (address)
```

However, there is no check that `investmentEnd > block.timestamp`.

This allows possible misconfiguration and creation of vaults where **the investment period has already ended**, making them:

* Unusable on deployment
* Unavailable for deposits or withdrawals
* Requiring manual remediation

## Location of Affected Code

    uint256 maxTotalDeposit,
    uint256 investmentEnd

            minTotalDeposit,
            maxDepositByUser,
            maxTotalDeposit,
            investmentEnd
        )
    );

    // use beacon proxy and not clone to deploy a vault
    BeaconProxy newVault = new BeaconProxy(address(vaultBeaconProxy), data);

    uint256 _vaultId = vaultId;

    vaults[_vaultId] = address(newVault);
    isVault[address(newVault)] = true;
    vaultId++;

    emit VaultDeployed(msg.sender, address(newVault), vaultId);

    return address(newVault);
}
```

## Recommendation

Add a simple validation check to ensure the investment period is in the future:

```solidity
if (investmentEnd <= block.timestamp) revert InvalidConfiguration();
```

Fixed.
